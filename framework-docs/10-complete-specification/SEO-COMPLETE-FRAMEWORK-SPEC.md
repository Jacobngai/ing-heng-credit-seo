1. **AI Does 95%, Humans Approve 5%**
   - Agents research, write, track, analyze, report
   - Humans only approve in D/A/F workflow

2. **D/A/F Workflow for Everything**
   - **D/** = Draft (AI-generated, awaiting review)
   - **A/** = Approved (human-validated, ready to use)
   - **F/** = Failed (rejected, archived)

3. **Five SEO Pillars** (addressing 30-year veteran's guide)
   - Content Lifecycle Management
   - Intent-Based Organization
   - Hub-and-Spoke Structure
   - Systematic Link Building
   - E-E-A-T Documentation

4. **Data-Driven Intelligence**
   - DataForSEO MCP for competitive analysis
   - Performance tracking and decay prevention
   - Continuous optimization

5. **Zero Breaking Changes**
   - Safe migration paths for existing sites
   - 301 redirect strategies
   - Backwards compatibility
