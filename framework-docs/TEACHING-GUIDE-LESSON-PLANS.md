4. Cheat sheets (one-page summaries)

### Instructor Notes

**Teaching Tips:**
1. Use analogies extensively (restaurant, factory, delivery)
2. Show real examples (open actual files)
3. Let students make mistakes (learning opportunity)
4. Celebrate small wins (completed first draft review!)
5. Pace according to class (some need more time)

**Common Student Struggles:**
1. Understanding D/A/F workflow → More examples needed
2. Reviewing drafts too slowly → Practice speed drills
3. Remembering all 14 commands → Use flashcards
4. Navigating folders → More scavenger hunts
5. Seeing the big picture → Start with visual diagrams

**Adaptation Strategies:**
- **Fast learners:** Give advanced projects early
- **Slow learners:** Break modules into smaller pieces
- **Visual learners:** Use more diagrams
- **Hands-on learners:** More practical exercises
- **Theory learners:** Provide written documentation
