## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Being Too Strict
**Problem:** Rejecting 40%+ of posts
**Fix:** Remember perfect is enemy of good. 70% quality published > 100% quality delayed

### Mistake 2: Being Too Lenient
**Problem:** Approving 95%+ of posts
**Fix:** Bad content hurts SEO. Better to reject mediocre content.

### Mistake 3: Overthinking
**Problem:** Spending 5 minutes per post analyzing deeply
**Fix:** Trust your gut. First impression is usually right.

### Mistake 4: Inconsistent Standards
**Problem:** Approving similar posts for one client, rejecting for another
**Fix:** Use the 100-point checklist to stay objective

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Brand Voice
**Problem:** Approving technically good content that sounds wrong
**Fix:** Read it in the client's voice. Does it sound like them?
