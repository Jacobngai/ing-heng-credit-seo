// FAQs - Comprehensive coverage for hauliers
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Can I finance used prime movers?',
    answer: 'Yes! We finance used prime movers up to 15 years old from reputable brands including Scania, Volvo, Mercedes, Hino, and UD Trucks. For trucks 5-10 years old, we offer up to 85% financing. For trucks 10-15 years old, financing up to 80% is available depending on condition. The truck must pass basic inspection and be in working condition. We understand Port Klang operators often prefer proven used trucks for reliability and lower cost.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer fleet financing for multiple prime movers?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! Fleet financing is available for 2 or more prime movers with special benefits: (1) Interest rate discount of 0.5-1.5% for volume purchases, (2) Single consolidated payment for easier cash flow management, (3) Faster approval process for fleet expansion, (4) Flexible down payment options (10-15% depending on fleet size). Perfect for hauliers expanding to meet shipping line contract requirements. We\'ve financed fleets up to 20 trucks for established Port Klang operators.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I have a shipping line contract?',
    answer: 'Excellent! Shipping line contracts (Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, Evergreen, etc.) significantly improve approval chances and terms. Benefits include: (1) Higher loan amounts (up to 90% vs 80% standard), (2) Better interest rates (0.5-1% discount), (3) Faster approval (within 2 hours for urgent contracts), (4) Longer payment terms available (up to 84 months). Submit your contract letter or purchase order along with your application. We understand contract-based revenue and structure financing accordingly.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance prime movers for Port Klang operations?',
    answer: 'Yes! We specialize in Port Klang container haulage financing. Over 60% of our prime mover clients operate in Klang Valley, Port Klang, Westports, and Northport areas. We understand: (1) Port Klang container volume cycles (peak season Nov-Feb, slow monsoon), (2) Shipping line contract requirements, (3) Detention and demurrage risks, (4) GPS tracking compliance for LPK (Lembaga Pelabuhan Klang). Our flexible payment plans align with Port Klang seasonal demand, helping you manage cash flow during slow months.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What brands of prime movers do you accept?',
    answer: 'We accept all major brands: European trucks (Scania, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, MAN, DAF, Iveco), Japanese trucks (Hino, UD Trucks, Isuzu), and Chinese trucks (Foton, Shacman, Sinotruk). European brands typically get better financing terms due to higher resale value. For Chinese brands, we may require 15-20% down payment. Both new and used trucks accepted. We evaluate based on condition, mileage, maintenance records, and market value.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does approval take?',
    answer: 'Standard approval: Same day (within 6-8 hours) for complete applications. Urgent approval: 2 hours for hauliers with immediate contract deadlines or tender opportunities. We prioritize Port Klang operators who need trucks quickly for shipping line contracts. Submit your application in the morning, get approval by afternoon, and pick up your truck within 3-5 days. This speed is crucial for container haulage where contracts can be won or lost based on equipment availability.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents are required for prime mover financing?',
    answer: 'For individuals/sole proprietors: (1) IC or Passport, (2) 6 months bank statements, (3) Income proof (contracts, trip sheets, bank deposits). For companies (Sdn Bhd): (1) SSM registration (Form 9/24/49), (2) Company bank statements (6 months), (3) Directors\' IC copies, (4) Shipping line contracts if available (improves approval). Optional but helpful: Trip records, GPS tracking reports, existing truck ownership proof, APAD permit copy. For used truck purchases, seller\'s grant/registration card required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can first-time owner-operators get financing?',
    answer: 'Yes! Many successful Port Klang hauliers started as drivers and became owner-operators through our financing. We evaluate: (1) Your driving experience (minimum 3 years prime mover/heavy truck), (2) Customer contracts or potential clients, (3) Business plan and revenue projections, (4) Personal financial stability. First-time operators typically start with 1 used prime mover (5-10 years old) with manageable monthly payments (RM 2,500-4,500). After 12-18 months of good payment history, fleet expansion financing becomes easier.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I have bad credit or CTOS issues?',
    answer: 'We specialize in approving applications that banks reject. Bad credit or CTOS/CCRIS issues don\'t mean automatic rejection. We look at: (1) Current financial situation and cash flow, (2) Existing contracts or customers, (3) Truck value and condition (serves as collateral), (4) Business track record in container haulage. Many successful clients had credit issues before working with us. The prime mover\'s value secures the loan, reducing risk. Higher down payment (15-20%) may be required for severe credit issues, but approval is possible.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer seasonal payment plans for hauliers?',
    answer: 'Yes! We understand container haulage has peak and slow seasons. Seasonal payment options include: (1) Higher payments during peak season (Chinese New Year rush Dec-Feb, year-end Oct-Dec), (2) Lower payments during slow periods (monsoon months, post-CNY lull), (3) Balloon payment structure with lower monthly payments and final balloon, (4) Grace periods during major festivals when operations slow. This flexibility helps Port Klang operators maintain positive cash flow year-round despite seasonal revenue fluctuations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I refinance existing prime mover loans?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! If you\'re paying high interest (above 10%) elsewhere, we can buy out your existing loan and provide better terms. Refinancing benefits: (1) Lower interest rates (save 2-4% annually), (2) Longer payment terms to reduce monthly burden, (3) Cash out for working capital (if truck value increased), (4) Consolidate multiple truck loans into one payment. Many clients refinance after 12-18 months when their business grows and they qualify for better rates. No penalty for early repayment on our loans.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a penalty for early repayment?',
    answer: 'No early repayment penalty! Pay off your loan anytime without extra charges. Many hauliers refinance after 12-24 months when their fleet grows and they qualify for better rates. You can also make extra payments during peak season (CNY rush, year-end) to reduce interest costs. This flexibility helps operators who experience sudden revenue growth from major contracts or project wins. Some clients pay off 3-year loans in 18-24 months and immediately expand their fleet.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What interest rates do you offer?',
    answer: 'Interest rates range from 6.5% to 11% per annum depending on: (1) Credit profile and score (better credit = lower rate), (2) Down payment amount (higher down = lower rate), (3) Loan term length (shorter term = lower rate), (4) Truck age and brand (newer European trucks = lower rate), (5) Existing contracts (shipping line contracts get 0.5-1% discount). Our rates are competitive vs banks (8-13%) and dealer financing (9-15%). Fleet financing gets additional 0.5-1.5% discount. Contact us for personalized quote based on your situation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I include trailer financing in the package?',
    answer: 'Yes! We offer combined prime mover + trailer financing packages. Options include: (1) Prime mover + 20ft/40ft container chassis, (2) Prime mover + flatbed trailer, (3) Prime mover + low loader trailer, (4) Complete turnkey package including GPS tracking system. Package deals often get better rates (0.5% discount) and single payment for both units. Perfect for new operators who need complete setup. We can also finance multiple trailers (2-3 units) per prime mover for operators who need backup chassis.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you require GPS tracking systems?',
    answer: 'GPS tracking is recommended but not mandatory. However, installing GPS offers benefits: (1) Better interest rates (0.3-0.5% discount), (2) Required for Port Klang LPK/APAD compliance, (3) Required by major shipping lines (Maersk, MSC), (4) Improves fleet efficiency and fuel savings, (5) Reduces insurance premiums. We can include GPS system cost in the financing package. Popular systems: GPS Fleet, KATSANA, MYEZTRACKER. For prime movers 7.5 tons and above operating at Port Klang, GPS is legally required for APAD permit.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens during monsoon season or slow periods?',
    answer: 'We understand container haulage in Malaysia has seasonal variations. Solutions include: (1) Seasonal payment plans (lower payments during monsoon Nov-Feb), (2) Payment deferrals (1-2 months during severe slow periods), (3) Interest-only payments temporarily during crisis, (4) Flexible payment dates aligned with major shipping cycles. Port Klang operators face 20-30% revenue drop during monsoon and post-CNY lull. Our financing accommodates this reality. Many banks don\'t understand haulage seasonality, but we do.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can foreigners apply for prime mover financing?',
    answer: 'Yes, foreigners with valid work permits and Malaysian company registration can apply. Requirements: (1) Valid passport and work permit/MM2H visa, (2) Malaysian business registration (SSM for Sdn Bhd or Enterprise), (3) Local guarantor (Malaysian citizen or PR), (4) 6 months Malaysian bank statements, (5) Higher down payment (15-20% vs 10% for citizens). Approval rate for foreigners: 80-85% (vs 95% for citizens). Many foreign investors in logistics/haulage have successfully financed fleets through us.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What areas in Malaysia do you serve?',
    answer: 'We serve all Malaysian states with focus on major logistics hubs: (1) Selangor & KL: Port Klang, Westports, Northport, Klang, Shah Alam, Petaling Jaya, (2) Johor: Pasir Gudang Port, Tanjung Pelepas Port, Johor Bahru (Singapore cross-border), (3) Penang: Penang Port, Butterworth, Bayan Lepas, (4) Other states: Melaka, Perak, Pahang (Kuantan Port), Sabah, Sarawak. Office in Klang, but we process applications nationwide via WhatsApp and online. Remote area processing available. Over 70% of our prime mover clients are Port Klang-based.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much can I borrow for a prime mover?',
    answer: 'Minimum loan: RM 40,000 for older used trucks (10-15 years). Maximum loan: RM 2,500,000 for fleet financing or premium new trucks. Typical financing: 80-90% of truck value (10-20% down payment). For new trucks: Up to 90% financing. For used 5-10 years: Up to 85% financing. For used 10-15 years: Up to 80% financing. Loan amount also depends on your income/revenue and repayment capacity. Monthly payment should not exceed 40% of your haulage revenue for sustainable operations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I trade in my old prime mover?',
    answer: 'Yes! Trade-in and upgrade programs available. Process: (1) Valuation of your current truck, (2) Settle remaining loan balance, (3) Apply trade-in value toward new/newer truck, (4) Finance the difference. After 12-18 months of timely payments, you can upgrade to larger, newer, or more efficient models. Many clients start with used Hino/UD trucks and upgrade to Scania/Volvo as business grows. Trade-ins help expand fleet without significant new capital injection. We work with used truck dealers across Port Klang area.'
