  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance used tower cranes?',
    answer: 'Yes! We finance used tower cranes up to 15 years old. For cranes 5-10 years old, standard financing terms apply (15-20% down payment, 5-7 year terms). For cranes 10-15 years old, we require 25-30% down payment and shorter loan terms (3-5 years). The crane must pass DOSH inspection and have valid Certificate of Fitness. Used cranes from reputable brands (Liebherr, Potain, Wolff) with maintenance records receive preferential approval.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance DOSH compliance upgrades?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! We understand DOSH 2024 Certificate of Fitness regulations. We finance: (1) Tower Crane Systems Monitoring (TSM) installation (RM100,000-250,000), (2) Anti-collision systems for multi-crane sites, (3) Load monitoring systems (LMI), (4) Anemometers and weather monitoring, (5) Operator cabin safety upgrades. Technology upgrades can be bundled with crane financing or financed separately for existing fleet upgrades.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the crane financing approval criteria?',
    answer: 'Key approval factors: (1) Crane rental business experience (minimum 2 years preferred), (2) Existing crane ownership or long-term rental history, (3) Active rental contracts or project pipeline (government projects preferred), (4) Financial statements showing rental revenue, (5) DOSH compliance track record (no major violations). First-time crane buyers with construction business background and secured rental contracts are considered. Approval rate for experienced operators: 90-95%.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do seasonal payment plans work for crane rental businesses?',
    answer: 'We recognize Malaysian construction seasonality. Standard seasonal plan: (1) Peak Season (Mar-Oct): 120% of standard monthly payment when utilization is 80-90%, (2) Monsoon Season (Nov-Feb): 60% of standard monthly payment when utilization drops to 50-70%. Annual payment total remains same, but cash flow aligned with revenue. This prevents defaults during slow months and helps maintain positive cash flow year-round. Available for loans above RM 1 million.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get fleet financing for multiple cranes?',
    answer: 'Yes! Fleet financing available for 2-5 cranes purchased simultaneously. Benefits: (1) Volume discount: 0.5-1% interest rate reduction, (2) Single consolidated monthly payment, (3) Streamlined approval process, (4) Mixed fleet financing (e.g., 2 tower cranes + 1 mobile crane). Ideal for operators expanding to meet high-rise boom demand in Klang Valley, Johor, and Penang. We\'ve financed fleets up to RM 25 million for established crane rental companies.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What loan amounts and terms are available?',
    answer: 'Loan amounts: Minimum RM 500,000 (mobile cranes), Maximum RM 10 million+ (crawler cranes, tower cranes, fleet packages). Down payment: 15-30% depending on crane age and brand. Loan terms: 5-7 years for new cranes, 3-5 years for used cranes. Interest rates: 6-10% per annum (lower for premium brands, higher for Chinese brands). Early repayment penalty: None. Maximum LTV: 85% for new cranes, 75% for used cranes.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance international crane purchases?',
    answer: 'Yes, we finance crane imports from Japan, Europe, China, and Korea. We work with: (1) Japanese used crane dealers (Tadano, Kobelco imports), (2) European new crane manufacturers (Liebherr, Potain), (3) Chinese manufacturers (Zoomlion, XCMG direct orders), (4) Korean manufacturers (Hyundai cranes). Import financing includes: crane cost, shipping, customs duties, import taxes, DOSH certification fees. Financing released upon crane arrival and DOSH inspection clearance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if my crane is idle during monsoon season?',
    answer: 'This is why we offer seasonal payment plans specifically for crane operators. Unlike banks with fixed monthly payments, we recognize that crane utilization drops 20-40% during monsoon months (November-February) due to weather-related work stoppages. Our seasonal plans reduce monthly payments during slow months. Additionally, we recommend: (1) Comprehensive insurance covering weather damage, (2) Monsoon maintenance scheduling, (3) Working capital facility for slow months. Many operators use monsoon downtime for crane maintenance and DOSH recertification.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I refinance existing crane loans?',
    answer: 'Yes! We offer crane loan refinancing and buyout services. Benefits of refinancing: (1) Lower interest rates (typically 2-4% reduction), (2) Better payment terms with seasonal flexibility, (3) Release equity for fleet expansion or working capital, (4) Consolidate multiple crane loans into single payment. Ideal for operators paying high interest rates (above 10%) from dealer financing or previous loans. Refinancing available after 12 months of timely payments on existing loan.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the DOSH Certificate of Fitness requirements?',
    answer: 'DOSH requires Certificate of Fitness (CF) renewal every 15 months via MyKKP portal. Requirements: (1) Licensed inspector verification, (2) Design and inspection reports, (3) Operator certification (CIDB/JKKP), (4) Safety systems functional (load indicators, anemometers), (5) Maintenance logs documented. Non-compliance penalty: Up to RM 100,000 fine. When financing cranes, we verify existing CF status and can include recertification costs in financing package. DOSH-compliant cranes receive preferential interest rates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance crane operator training programs?',
    answer: 'While we primarily finance equipment, we recognize the crane operator shortage challenge. For fleet financing above RM 3 million, we can include: (1) CIDB operator training program costs, (2) Akademi Binaan Malaysia (ABM) training fees, (3) Operator certification renewal costs, (4) Safety training programs. This helps crane rental companies build proprietary operator pools as competitive advantage. Training costs (RM 10,000-30,000 per operator) can be added to equipment financing package.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What insurance is required for financed cranes?',
    answer: 'Comprehensive crane insurance mandatory for all financed equipment. Required coverage: (1) Equipment damage insurance (fire, theft, vandalism), (2) Third-party liability (RM 5-10 million coverage), (3) Cargo insurance during transport, (4) Weather damage coverage (wind, flood).

    answer: 'Yes, foreign companies with Malaysian operations can apply. Requirements: (1) Malaysian company registration (SSM), (2) Valid business license for crane rental operations, (3) Malaysian directors or local partners, (4) 2+ years operating history in Malaysia preferred, (5) Financial statements and tax filings. Foreign companies from Singapore, China, Japan involved in Malaysian construction boom are welcome. Approval rates slightly lower (75-85%) compared to Malaysian companies due to additional documentation verification.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the tax benefits of crane financing?',
    answer: 'Crane financing offers significant tax advantages: (1) Monthly interest payments are tax-deductible business expenses, (2) Depreciation claims on crane value (typically 14.29% per year over 7 years), (3) Maintenance and insurance costs fully deductible, (4) Operator salary and training costs deductible. Effective tax savings: 15-25% of total equipment cost over loan term. Consult your tax advisor, but financing typically offers better tax position than outright cash purchase. Leasing structures also available for specific tax planning needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance cranes for specific projects only?',
    answer: 'No, we finance cranes for general crane rental business operations, not project-specific.

    answer: 'Yes! Trade-in and upgrade programs available. Process: (1) We assess your existing crane\'s market value, (2) Trade-in value applied as down payment toward new crane, (3) Remaining loan balance on old crane refinanced if applicable, (4) Single new loan for the new crane. Popular upgrade paths: (1) Chinese brands (Zoomlion, XCMG) to Japanese brands (Tadano, Kobelco) - 30% reliability improvement, (2) Old mobile cranes to tower cranes - capturing high-rise boom, (3) Standard tower cranes to TSM-equipped smart cranes - DOSH compliance + premium rental rates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What areas in Malaysia do you serve?',
    answer: 'We serve all major construction markets nationwide: (1) Klang Valley (KL, Selangor): Highest crane demand, high-rise boom, MRT3 projects, (2) Johor (Johor Bahru, Iskandar Malaysia): RTS project, Forest City, high-rise development, (3) Penang (Georgetown, Bayan Lepas): Industrial parks, high-rise residential, LRT project, (4) Perak, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan: Infrastructure and industrial projects, (5) Sabah, Sarawak (East Malaysia): Pan Borneo Highway, resource projects.

  },
  {
    question: 'What makes your crane financing different from banks?',
    answer: 'Key differences: (1) Crane rental industry expertise - We understand utilization rates, seasonal cycles, project economics. Banks don\'t. (2) Seasonal payment flexibility - Aligned with monsoon season revenue fluctuations. Banks offer fixed payments only. (3) Technology financing - We bundle DOSH compliance upgrades.

(8) Operator shortage solutions - Include training costs in financing.'

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
          TSM-equipped cranes command 10-20% rental premium (RM 15,000-30,000 extra monthly revenue for tower cranes). Insurance savings: 5-15% annually (RM 5,000-15,000). Accident prevention value: Potentially millions in liability/downtime avoidance. Payback period for technology investment: Typically 2-3 years. Major developers increasingly require TSM on multi-crane sites.
