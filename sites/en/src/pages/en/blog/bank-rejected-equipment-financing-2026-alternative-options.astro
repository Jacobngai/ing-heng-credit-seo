# Bank Rejected Equipment Financing - 2026 Alternative Options

## Banks Reject Many Equipment Financing Applications

Banks reject equipment financing for many reasons:
- Equipment older than 5 years
- Insufficient down payment (10-20%)
- Company too new
- Credit score issues
- Documentation problems

When banks say no, your business stalls. You can't get the equipment you need.

## Ing Heng Approves Where Banks Reject

We provide equipment financing when banks reject you. We offer 0% down payment instead of 10-20%. We finance equipment of any age.

We look at your business potential, not just past problems.

## Comparison: Banks vs Ing Heng

| Feature | Banks | Ing Heng Credit |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Down Payment | 10-20% required | 0% |
| Loan Amount | 90% only | 100% |
| Equipment Age | Under 5 years | No limit |
| Approval Rate | Strict | Flexible |

## Real Example: Bank Rejection to Ing Heng Approval

Equipment Needed: RM 50,000 Used Excavator

**Bank Response:**
- Status: REJECTED
- Reason: All equipment accepted based on condition (over 5-year limit)
- Down payment issue: Customer had only RM 2,000

**Ing Heng Response:**
- Status: APPROVED
- Down payment: RM 0 (only RM 2,000 available was fine)
- Equipment age: 7 years accepted
- Loan: RM 50,000 (100%)
