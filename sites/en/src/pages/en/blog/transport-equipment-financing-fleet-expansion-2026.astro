# Transport Equipment Financing - Fleet Expansion 2026

## Banks Limit Fleet Expansion

When transport companies need more lorries and prime movers, banks require 10-20% down payment per vehicle. They finance only 90% of vehicle value.

For 5 lorries at RM 80,000 each (RM 400,000 total), banks want RM 40,000 to RM 80,000 down. This blocks fleet expansion.

Banks also reject vehicles older than 5 years.

## Ing Heng Supports Fleet Expansion

We provide transport equipment financing with 0% down payment. You get 100% full loan. No age limit on vehicles.

Our rates compete with bank rates of 4.6% to 6.0% per year.

| Loan Amount | 90% | 100% |
| Vehicle Age | Under 5 years | No limit |
