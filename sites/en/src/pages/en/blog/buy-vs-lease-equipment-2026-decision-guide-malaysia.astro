# Buy vs Lease Equipment - 2026 Decision Guide Malaysia

## Bank Financing Makes Buying Hard

Many contractors lease equipment because buying requires 10-20% down payment at banks. Banks only finance 90% of equipment value.

For RM 100,000 equipment, banks want RM 10,000 to RM 20,000 down. Most choose leasing to avoid this cash outlay.

Banks also reject equipment older than 5 years, limiting purchase options.

## Ing Heng Makes Buying Easy with 0% Down

We provide equipment financing with 0% down payment to BUY equipment. You get 100% full loan and own the equipment.

No age limit means you can buy cost-effective used equipment.

## Comparison: Lease vs Buy with Ing Heng

| Feature | Lease/Rental | Buy (Banks) | Buy (Ing Heng) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Down Payment | Deposit | 10-20% | 0% |
| Ownership | Never | After loan | From day 1 |
| Equipment Age | New only | Under 5 years | No limit |
| Monthly Cost | High | Medium | Competitive |

## Real Example: 3-Year Cost Comparison

- Monthly rental: RM 3,000
- 3 years total: RM 108,000

## Why Buying is Better Than Leasing
