# Refinancing Equipment 2026 - Unlock Equity Guide

Own equipment but need cash? Refinancing lets you unlock equity without selling. Here's the 2026 guide.

## What is Equipment Refinancing?

Refinancing means:
- Borrow against owned equipment
- Get cash for business use
- Keep using equipment
- Flexible repayment terms

## Why Refinance Equipment in 2026?

**Common Reasons:**
- Business expansion
- Working capital needs
- Emergency expenses
- Debt consolidation
- New equipment purchase
- Contract opportunities

## Refinancing vs New Financing

| Feature | Refinancing | New Financing |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Equipment Status** | Already owned | New purchase |
| **Cash Received** | Up to 80% value | 100% of price |
| **Interest Rate** | Lower (secured) | Standard rate |
| **Approval** | Faster | Standard process |
| **Equipment Age** | Important factor | Less important |

## How Much Can You Refinance?

**Equipment Value Factors:**
1. **Current market value** - Not original price
2. **Age and condition** - Newer = higher %
3. **Type of equipment** - Excavators = higher value
4. **Maintenance records** - Well-maintained = better terms

**Typical Loan-to-Value (LTV):**
- New equipment (1-2 years): 70-80%
- Mid-life (3-5 years): 60-70%
- Older (6-10 years): 40-60%

## Real Example: Excavator Refinancing

**Owned Excavator:**
- Original price: RM 200,000 (2 years ago)
- Current value: RM 150,000
- Refinance amount: RM 105,000 (70%)
- Monthly (5 years): ~RM 2,100

**Use cash for:**
- New forklift purchase
- Working capital
- Hire 2 more workers
- Take on bigger contracts

## Bank Refinancing Requirements 2026

| Requirement | Bank | Ing Heng |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Ownership Period** | Minimum 2 years | 6 months OK |
| **Equipment Age** | Under 7 years | Up to 10 years |
| **LTV Ratio** | 50-60% | Up to 80% |
| **Documentation** | Valuation required | Simple assessment |
| **Approval Time** | 2-3 weeks | fasts |

## Equipment We Refinance

**High LTV (70-80%):**
- Komatsu excavators (PC200, PC300)
- CAT excavators (320, 336)
- Prime movers (Volvo, Scania)

- ISUZU, FUSO, HINO lorries
- Toyota forklifts
- TCM forklifts

**Lower LTV (40-60%):**
- Older equipment (7-10 years)
- Small machinery
- Specialized equipment

## 2026 Refinancing Benefits

1. **Keep Equipment** - No disruption to operations
2. **Lower Interest** - Secured loan rates
3. **Flexible Terms** - 1-7 year options
4. **Fast Cash** - Money in fasts
5. **Tax Deductible** - Interest expenses

- Equipment details
- Current photos
- Usage information

**Step 2: Valuation (fasts)**
- Market value check

## Documentation Required

1. **Equipment proof**

   - Insurance policy

2. **Business documents**
   - SSM registration
   - 6 months bank statements
   - Latest audited accounts

3. **Equipment condition**

## Bad Credit Refinancing

Banks may reject if:
- Poor CCRIS score
- Late payments visible
- High debt service ratio

Ing Heng considers:
- Equipment value primary
- Income secondary
- Bad credit possible
- Bank rejection cases welcome

## Refinancing vs Selling

**Why Refinance Instead of Sell?**

| Factor | Refinancing | Selling |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Keep Equipment** | Yes | No |
| **Get Cash** | Yes | Yes |
| **Business Impact** | None | Major disruption |
| **Process Time** | 3-5 days | Weeks/months |
| **Future Use** | Continue | Lost |

## Real Example: Fleet Refinancing

**Construction Company:**
- 3 excavators owned
- Total value: RM 450,000
- Refinance 70%: RM 315,000
- Monthly payment: RM 6,300

**Use cash to:**
- Purchase 2 new lorries
- Hire 5 workers
- Expand to new construction sites

## 2026 Refinancing Tips

1. **Check equipment value first** - Get realistic estimate
2. **Compare LTV ratios** - Higher % = more cash
3. **Consider term length** - Longer = lower monthly
4. **Plan use of funds** - Business expansion ideal
5. **Maintain insurance** - Required throughout loan

## Interest Rates 2026

**Refinancing Rates:**
- New equipment (1-3 years): 4.5-5.5%
- Mid-life (4-6 years): 5.0-6.0%
- Older (7-10 years): 5.5-6.5%

**Factors affecting rate:**
- Equipment age
