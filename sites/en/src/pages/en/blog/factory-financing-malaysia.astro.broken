        Looking to purchase, build, or expand your factory in Malaysia? This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about factory financing—from loan types and eligibility requirements to application tips and government incentives available in 2026.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Factory Financing?</h2>
      <p>
        Factory financing is a specialized form of commercial property lending designed for manufacturing businesses in Malaysia. Unlike standard business loans, factory financing is structured specifically for industrial properties—taking into account factors like industrial land zoning, manufacturing equipment integration, and the unique cash flow patterns of production businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a startup looking to establish your first production facility, an SME ready to expand operations, or an established manufacturer seeking to upgrade your premises, understanding your factory financing options is crucial for making informed decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Factory Financing in Malaysia</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Factory Purchase Loans</h3>
      <p>
        The most common type of factory financing, purchase loans allow you to buy existing factory buildings or industrial units. These loans typically cover 70-80% of the property value with repayment terms of 15-25 years. Interest rates range from 4.5% to 7% depending on the lender and your business profile.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Factory Construction Financing</h3>
      <p>
        If you're building a custom factory on industrial land, construction financing provides staged disbursements aligned with building milestones. This type of loan often requires you to own the land (or finance it separately) and includes oversight of the construction process by the lending institution.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Factory Renovation & Upgrade Loans</h3>
      <p>
        For businesses upgrading existing facilities—whether for capacity expansion, technology upgrades, or compliance with new regulations—renovation loans offer flexible financing of RM100,000 to RM5 million with terms of 3-10 years.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Combined Factory + Equipment Packages</h3>
      <p>
        Many Malaysian manufacturers need both premises and machinery. Combined financing packages bundle property loans with equipment financing, offering potential savings on interest rates and simplified administration through a single lender relationship.
      </p>

      <h2>Eligibility Requirements for Factory Loans</h2>
      <p>

        <li><strong>Operating History:</strong> Minimum 2 years in business (some lenders accept 1 year with strong financials)</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Government Incentives & Schemes (2026)</h2>
      <p>
        The Malaysian government offers several programs to support manufacturing businesses seeking factory financing:
      </p>
      
      <h3>SME Bank Factory Financing</h3>
      <p>
        SME Bank provides specialized industrial property loans with competitive rates starting from 4% p.a. and lower down payment requirements for qualifying SMEs. Their Factory and Industrial Facility Scheme supports purchases up to RM10 million.
      </p>

      <h3>MIDF Industrial Property Loans</h3>
      <p>
        The Malaysian Industrial Development Finance Berhad (MIDF) offers long-term financing for industrial properties with terms up to 20 years and competitive rates for manufacturing businesses contributing to national development goals.
      </p>

      <h3>Regional Development Incentives</h3>
      <p>
        Businesses establishing factories in designated development corridors (Northern Corridor, East Coast Economic Region, Iskandar Malaysia) may qualify for additional incentives including tax breaks and preferential financing terms.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Apply for Factory Financing</h2>
