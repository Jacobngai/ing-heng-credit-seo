# Manufacturing Equipment Financing - Industry 4.0 2026

## Banks Hinder Industry 4.0 Adoption

When manufacturers want to upgrade to Industry 4.0, banks require 10-20% down payment. They finance only 90% of equipment value.

For automation equipment costing RM 500,000, banks want RM 50,000 to RM 100,000 down. This delays modernization.

Banks also reject equipment older than 5 years, which hurts manufacturers wanting to upgrade gradually.

## Ing Heng Supports Industry 4.0

We provide manufacturing equipment financing with 0% down payment. You get 100% full loan. No age limit on equipment.

Our rates compete with bank rates of 4.6% to 6.0% per year.
