# Machinery Financing Malaysia - 2026 Budget Guide for Contractors

## The Problem with Bank Financing

Banks in Malaysia have strict rules for machinery financing. They require 10-20% down payment upfront. They only finance 90% of equipment value. Banks also reject equipment older than 5 years.

For a RM 50,000 machine, you need RM 5,000 to RM 10,000 cash down. This hurts your cash flow.

## Ing Heng Credit Makes It Easy

We offer 0% down payment on machinery financing. You get 100% full loan. We finance equipment of any age - no limits.

Bank interest rates: 4.6% to 6.0% per year. Our rates are competitive too.
