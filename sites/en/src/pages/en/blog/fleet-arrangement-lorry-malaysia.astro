      Planning to expand your logistics fleet? You don't need to buy lorries one at a time. <strong>Fleet arrangement financing</strong> lets you acquire 5-10 (or more) lorries in one go — with synchronized financing, easier management, and often better terms than single-vehicle loans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's what you need to know about fleet arrangement for lorries in Malaysia in 2026.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is Fleet Arrangement Financing?</h2>

    <p>
      Fleet arrangement is bulk financing designed for businesses that need multiple commercial vehicles. Instead of applying for lorry financing five separate times, you bundle everything into one package.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>You identify the lorries you need (e.g., 3× 1-ton lorries, 2× 3-ton box lorries, 2× refrigerated trucks)</li>
      <li>Apply for fleet arrangement financing with total financing amount</li>
      <li>Get approval for the entire fleet (or phased deployment)</li>
      <li>All vehicles financed under one master agreement</li>
      <li>Single monthly payment covering the entire fleet</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is particularly useful for logistics companies, distribution businesses, construction firms, and F&B suppliers who operate multiple delivery vehicles.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Needs Fleet Arrangement?</h2>

    <p>Fleet arrangement makes sense if you're in:</p>

    <h3>1. Logistics & Transportation</h3>
    <p>
      Courier companies, freight forwarders, and last-mile delivery businesses need multiple lorries to serve different routes and handle varying cargo sizes. A typical setup might be 5× 1-ton lorries for urban delivery and 3× 3-ton lorries for interstate routes.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Construction & Contracting</h3>
    <p>
      Construction firms need lorries for material delivery, waste disposal, and equipment transport. A mixed fleet (e.g., 4× dump trucks, 3× flatbed lorries, 2× crane lorries) lets you handle different project requirements without relying on rentals.
    </p>

    <h3>3. F&B Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      Food distributors, catering companies, and wholesale suppliers need refrigerated lorries (chiller trucks) to maintain cold chain integrity. A fleet of 5-8 chiller lorries allows you to expand your service area and handle multiple deliveries simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Manufacturing & Supply Chain</h3>
    <p>
      Manufacturers who do their own distribution need lorries for raw material pickup and finished goods delivery. Fleet arrangement lets you internalize logistics instead of relying on third-party transporters.
    </p>

    <h2>Fleet Arrangement Financing Options in Malaysia</h2>

    <h3>Option 1: Hire Purchase (HP) Fleet</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses that want to own the lorries outright at the end of the financing period.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finance the full fleet value (or 70-100% depending on deposit)</li>
      <li>Fixed monthly installments for 5-7 years</li>
      <li>Lorries registered under your company name</li>
      <li>You own all vehicles after final payment</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Typical terms (Ing Heng Credit):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>0% deposit for qualifying businesses</li>
      <li>Up to 7 years repayment</li>
      <li>Fixed monthly payment</li>
      <li>No age limit on vehicle (finance used lorries too)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Option 2: Operating Lease Fleet</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses that prefer off-balance-sheet financing and don't need to own the vehicles.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Leasing company owns the lorries</li>
      <li>You pay monthly lease rental</li>
      <li>Vehicles registered under lessor's name</li>
      <li>Option to purchase at end of lease term</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Lower monthly payments, off-balance-sheet treatment, easier upgrades</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> You don't own the vehicles, potential mileage restrictions</p>

    <h3>Option 3: Finance Lease Fleet</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses that want ownership benefits with leasing flexibility.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hybrid between hire purchase and operating lease</li>
      <li>You use the lorries and have ownership rights</li>
      <li>Purchase option at nominal amount at end of term</li>
      <li>Typically treated as asset purchase for accounting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Structure Your Fleet Arrangement</h2>

    <p>
      The best fleet mix depends on your business operations. Here are common configurations:
    </p>

      <li>3× 3-ton box lorries (regional)</li>

      <li>Specialized vehicles (chillers, tankers, tippers)</li>
      <li>Potential phased deployment (10 now, 10 in 6 months)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Established logistics companies, national distributors</p>

    <h2>Requirements for Fleet Arrangement Financing</h2>

    <p>
      To qualify for fleet arrangement financing in Malaysia, you typically need:
    </p>

    <h3>Business Requirements:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SSM Registration:</strong> Active company registration (Sdn Bhd, Enterprise, Partnership)</li>
      <li><strong>Operating History:</strong> Minimum 1-2 years in business (some lenders flexible for strong profiles)</li>
      <li><strong>Revenue Proof:</strong> 6-12 months bank statements showing healthy cash flow</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Documentation Checklist:</h3>

      <li>Latest 2 years audited accounts (or management accounts)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Special Considerations for Fleet Financing:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> Banks typically require 20-30% down payment. Ing Heng Credit offers 0% deposit options for qualifying businesses.</li>

      <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Comprehensive insurance required for all vehicles in the fleet</li>
      <li><strong>GPS tracking:</strong> Some financiers require GPS installation for fleet monitoring (particularly for high-value fleets)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cost Example: Fleet Arrangement vs. Individual Financing</h2>

    <p>
      Let's compare the total cost of acquiring 5× 3-ton box lorries (RM 90,000 each = RM 450,000 total) over 5 years:
    </p>

    <h3>Scenario 1: Fleet Arrangement (0% Deposit)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Financing:</strong> RM 450,000</li>
      <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> RM 0 (0% down payment)</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly Payment (5 years):</strong> ~RM 8,800/month</li>
      <li><strong>Processing Fee:</strong> RM 4,500 (1% of total)</li>
      <li><strong>Total Cost:</strong> RM 532,500 (including interest estimate)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scenario 2: Individual Financing (20% Deposit × 5 Lorries)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Financing:</strong> RM 360,000 (80% of RM 450,000)</li>
      <li><strong>Deposit Required:</strong> RM 90,000 (20% × RM 450,000) — upfront cash needed</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly Payment (5 years):</strong> ~RM 7,000/month</li>
      <li><strong>Processing Fee:</strong> RM 4,500 (5 separate applications × RM 900)</li>
      <li><strong>Total Cost:</strong> RM 516,000 (including interest estimate)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The Real Cost Difference:</strong></p>
    <p>
      While individual financing has a slightly lower total cost, you need <strong>RM 90,000 upfront cash</strong>. With fleet arrangement at 0% deposit, you keep that RM 90,000 in your business for operations, fuel, hiring drivers, and handling cashflow gaps.
    </p>

    <p>
      For most SMEs, <strong>preserving working capital is more valuable than saving RM 16,500 over 5 years</strong> (that's only RM 275/month difference).
    </p>

    <h2>How to Apply for Fleet Arrangement Financing</h2>

    <p><strong>Step 1: Assess Your Fleet Needs</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determine how many lorries you need and what types</li>
      <li>Calculate your monthly revenue potential with the new fleet</li>
      <li>Ensure you have enough drivers and operational infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 2: Get Lorry Quotations</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit dealers or browse used lorry listings</li>
      <li>Negotiate bulk purchase pricing (mention you're buying 5+ units)</li>
      <li>Get official quotations with detailed specs</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 3: Prepare Documentation</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gather all required documents (SSM, bank statements, accounts)</li>
      <li>Prepare a simple fleet utilization plan explaining how you'll deploy the lorries</li>
      <li>Show clear revenue projections if possible</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 4: Submit Application</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply with a financier experienced in fleet arrangements (like Ing Heng Credit)</li>
      <li>Provide all documentation and quotations</li>
      <li>Be ready to discuss your business operations and growth plans</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 5: Approval and Deployment</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wait for approval (typically 3-7 days for complete applications)</li>
      <li>Sign financing agreement and insurance documents</li>
      <li>Coordinate lorry delivery with dealer</li>
      <li>Arrange insurance, road tax, and GPS installation (if required)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fleet Management Tips After Financing</h2>

    <p>
      Once you've acquired your fleet, proper management keeps operations smooth and protects your investment:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Synchronized Maintenance</h3>
    <p>
      Schedule regular servicing for all lorries on the same cycle (e.g., monthly preventive maintenance). This prevents unexpected breakdowns during peak delivery periods.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Driver Assignment & Accountability</h3>
    <p>
      Assign specific drivers to specific lorries. This creates accountability and helps you track fuel consumption, wear and tear, and driver performance.
    </p>

    <h3>3. GPS Tracking & Route Optimization</h3>
    <p>
      Install GPS trackers to monitor lorry locations, optimize routes, and reduce fuel waste. This pays for itself within 6 months through efficiency gains.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Fuel Management System</h3>
    <p>
      Track fuel consumption per lorry. Sudden increases signal problems (fuel theft, inefficient routes, mechanical issues).
    </p>

    <h3>5. Insurance & Road Tax Renewal</h3>
    <p>
      Maintain a master spreadsheet tracking insurance renewal dates, road tax expiry, and Puspakom inspection schedules. Missed renewals can ground your entire fleet.
    </p>
