    question: 'What are the main machinery financing options in Malaysia?',
    answer: 'The primary options are Industrial Hire Purchase (HP), Leasing, and Term Loans. Hire Purchase is most common for SMEs because it allows for ownership at the end of the term and often comes with 0% down payment options from specialized lenders like Ing Heng Credit.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I choose between a bank and an alternative lender for machinery?',
    answer: 'Banks offer lower interest rates but have strict requirements (10-20% down payment, no equipment older than 5 years). Alternative lenders like Ing Heng Credit are faster (48-hour approval), offer 0% down payment, and finance equipment regardless of age, which preserves your working capital.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get 100% financing for machinery in Malaysia?',
    answer: 'Yes, 100% financing (0% down payment) is available through specialized credit companies. This is ideal for SMEs that want to keep their cash reserves for operations, materials, and hiring while putting the machinery to work immediately.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does the age of the machinery matter for financing?',
    answer: 'For banks, yes—they typically won\'t finance machines older than 5-7 years. At Ing Heng Credit, we have no age limit. We understand that a well-maintained 15-year-old excavator or CNC machine still generates revenue for your business.'

      <p>
        Running a business in Malaysia is all about timing. You see a big project or a new contract opportunity. You know your current equipment can't handle the load. You need a new CNC machine, a higher-capacity excavator, or a fleet of forklifts.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        But then you look at the price tag. RM300,000. RM500,000. Maybe even over RM1 million. 
      </p>

      <p>
        For most SMEs, paying cash upfront isn't just difficult—it's risky. It drains your working capital, leaving you with no safety net for raw materials, payroll, or rainy days. This is where <strong>machinery financing options</strong> become your most important growth tool. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's break down the different ways you can fund your equipment in Malaysia in 2026, and how to choose the one that keeps your cash flow healthy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-slate-900">1. Industrial Hire Purchase (The SME Favorite)</h2>
      <p>
        Hire Purchase (HP) is the most popular machinery financing option in Malaysia. Why? Because it's straightforward. You pay a deposit (or 0% if you're with us), and the lender pays the rest. You use the machine while paying monthly installments, and once the final payment is made, the machine is 100% yours.
      </p>

        <h4 class="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Why SMEs Choose Hire Purchase:</h4>
        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-primary mt-1">✅</span>
            <span><strong>Ownership:</strong> You own the asset at the end of the term.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-primary mt-1">✅</span>
            <span><strong>Fixed Rates:</strong> Your installments don't change, making budgeting easy.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <span class="text-primary mt-1">✅</span>
            <span><strong>Asset as Security:</strong> The machine itself is the collateral. You don't need to put your house or land on the line.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-slate-900">2. Equipment Leasing (The Operating Option)</h2>
      <p>
        Leasing is similar to renting. You pay to use the machinery for a set period. In Malaysia, "Operating Leases" are common for equipment that becomes obsolete quickly (like high-tech manufacturing systems or IT infrastructure).
      </p>
      <p>
        The catch? At the end of the lease, you usually don't own the machine. You either return it, upgrade to a newer model, or pay a "residual value" to buy it out. It's great for keeping your balance sheet light, but most contractors and manufacturers prefer the equity of ownership that Hire Purchase provides.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-slate-900">3. Bank Term Loans (The Traditional Path)</h2>
      <p>
        You can go to a bank for a general business term loan to buy equipment. Banks often offer the lowest interest rates, but they come with the most "headaches."
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Expect to provide three years of audited accounts, six months of bank statements, and a lot of patience. Banks are also very picky about <em>what</em> they finance. If the machine is more than 5 years old, or if it's a niche brand, a bank will likely say no.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-slate-900">The 0% Deposit Secret: Why Preserving Working Capital Matters</h2>
      <p>
        We've seen too many businesses fail because they were "asset rich but cash poor." They spent all their cash buying a beautiful new machine, only to realize they didn't have the RM50,000 needed for the first month's raw materials or the RM20,000 for driver wages.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When you choose a <strong>0% deposit machinery financing option</strong>, you keep your cash where it belongs—in your business account.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Think about it: RM100,000 sitting in your bank account is a safety net. RM100,000 "trapped" in a machine's down payment is money you can't touch. In the logistics and construction world, cash flow is king. Always choose the option that protects your liquid cash.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-slate-900">Industry-Specific Options</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">For Contractors (Excavators & Cranes)</h3>
      <p>
        Projects often pay on a "milestone" basis. You might wait 60 or 90 days for a payment. You need financing that offers flexible terms and potentially "seasonal" adjustments if your work depends on weather or project cycles.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">For Manufacturers (CNC & Automation)</h3>
      <p>
        With the push toward <strong>Industry 4.0</strong>, many manufacturers are upgrading to robotic systems. These machines have a high initial cost but long lifespans. Long-term Hire Purchase (up to 7 years) is often the best fit here to match the investment with the machine's productive life.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">For Logistics (Lorry & Prime Mover)</h3>
      <p>
        If you're expanding your fleet, consider "Fleet Arrangement" options. Instead of financing lorries one by one, you bundle 5 or 10 units into one package. This simplifies your accounting and often gets you a better overall rate.
      </p>
