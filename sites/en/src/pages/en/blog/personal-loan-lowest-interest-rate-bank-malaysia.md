# Personal Loan Lowest Interest Rate Bank Malaysia: Complete 2025 Guide

Looking for the lowest personal loan interest rate in Malaysia? Smart move. With rates ranging from 5% to 18%, choosing the right lender can save you thousands in interest over your loan term.

Let's cut through the marketing fluff and look at real rates, eligibility requirements, and which banks actually deliver what they advertise.

## Quick Answer: Which Bank Has the Lowest Personal Loan Rate?

**The honest answer:** It depends on your profile.

Banks offer different rates based on your credit score, income, and relationship with them. That "from 5%" rate you see advertised? Most people don't qualify for it.

Here's what we see in practice:

**For excellent credit (CTOS 700+):**
- Major banks: 5.5% - 7.5%
- Second-tier banks: 6.5% - 8.5%
- Licensed lenders: 8% - 12%

**For average credit (CTOS 600-699):**
- Major banks: 8% - 12%
- Second-tier banks: 10% - 14%
- Licensed lenders: 12% - 16%

**For challenged credit (CTOS below 600):**
- Major banks: Often rejected
- Second-tier banks: 12% - 16%
- Licensed lenders: 14% - 18%

Let's break down what affects your rate and how to get the best deal.

## What Determines Your Personal Loan Interest Rate?

Banks don't just pick a number. Your rate depends on:

### 1. Your Credit Score (CTOS/CCRIS)
This is the biggest factor. A clean credit history with on-time payments gets you the best rates. Late payments, defaults, or high credit utilization push your rate higher.

### 2. Your Income Level
Higher income = lower risk = better rates. Most banks have rate tiers:
- RM 3,000-4,999: Higher rates
- RM 5,000-9,999: Mid-tier rates
- RM 10,000+: Best rates

### 3. Loan Amount
Larger loans sometimes get better rates (more interest for the bank). But only borrow what you need — chasing a lower rate isn't worth paying interest on money you don't use.

### 4. Loan Tenure
Longer terms often have higher interest rates. A 1-year loan might be 6%, while a 5-year loan could be 8%. You pay less interest overall with shorter terms, even if the rate is similar.

### 5. Your Banking Relationship
Existing customers with salary crediting or fixed deposits often get preferential rates (0.5% - 2% discount).

## Major Banks: Personal Loan Interest Rates Comparison

Here's what we see from Malaysia's major banks (rates as of early 2025):

### Maybank Personal Loan
**Advertised Rate:** From 5.99% p.a.
**Realistic Rate:** 7% - 12% for most borrowers
**Eligibility:** RM 2,500 minimum income

**Notes:** Better rates if you have Maybank salary account or fixed deposit.

### CIMB Personal Loan
**Advertised Rate:** From 5.60% p.a.
**Realistic Rate:** 6.5% - 11% for most borrowers
**Eligibility:** RM 2,500 minimum income
**Max Amount:** RM 150,000

**Realistic Rate:** 7% - 12% for most borrowers
**Eligibility:** RM 2,000 minimum income
**Max Amount:** RM 150,000

### Hong Leong Bank Personal Loan
**Advertised Rate:** From 6.88% p.a.
**Realistic Rate:** 7.5% - 13% for most borrowers
**Eligibility:** RM 2,500 minimum income
**Max Amount:** RM 150,000

### RHB Bank Personal Loan

**Realistic Rate:** 7% - 12% for most borrowers
**Eligibility:** RM 2,000 minimum income
**Max Amount:** RM 150,000

- Excellent credit scores (CTOS 750+)
- Existing bank customers with strong relationships
- Shorter loan tenures (1-2 years)

Most borrowers get rates 2-4% higher than advertised minimums.

## Licensed Lenders: When Banks Say No

If banks reject you due to credit issues, self-employment, or gig work, licensed lenders are your option. Rates are higher, but approval is more flexible.

### What to Expect from Licensed Lenders

**Interest Rates:** 10% - 18% p.a. (higher than banks)
**Approval Time:** 24-48 hours (much faster than banks)
**Documentation:** Less strict (bank statements, EPF statements often enough)
**Credit Requirements:** More flexible (bad credit OK, CTOS below 600 considered)

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Unlicensed lenders (check Bank Negara Malaysia registry)
- Upfront fees before approval
- Rates above 18% p.a.
- Pressure tactics or threats

We work with licensed lenders daily. Yes, rates are higher, but for businesses that need fast funding or have imperfect credit, it's often the only viable option.

## How to Get the Lowest Rate: Practical Steps

### Step 1: Check Your CTOS Score First
Don't apply blindly. Check your CTOS report before applying (www.ctoscredit.com.my). Knowing your score helps you target the right lenders and avoid unnecessary rejections.

**CTOS Score Guide:**
- 750+: Excellent — Target bank advertised rates
- 650-749: Good — Expect mid-range bank rates
- 550-649: Fair — Consider second-tier banks or licensed lenders
- Below 550: Challenged — Focus on licensed lenders with flexible criteria

### Step 2: Apply to Your Existing Bank First
If you have salary crediting or a fixed deposit with a bank, apply there first. Relationship pricing can save you 1-2% on interest rates.

### Step 3: Compare at Least 3 Lenders
Don't settle for the first offer. Rates vary significantly:
- Bank A might offer 8%
- Bank B might offer 10%
- Licensed lender might offer 14%

On a RM 50,000 loan over 5 years:
- 8% = RM 10,160 total interest
- 10% = RM 12,748 total interest
- 14% = RM 18,475 total interest

That 2% difference costs you RM 2,588. Worth shopping around.

### Step 4: Negotiate (Yes, It Works)
If you get multiple offers, use them as leverage. "Bank A offered me 9%, can you match it?" Often works, especially if you're a good credit risk.

### Step 5: Consider Shorter Tenures
If you can afford higher monthly payments, choose a shorter tenure. You'll pay less interest overall, even if the rate is the same.

**Example: RM 30,000 loan at 8%**
- 5 years: RM 608/month, RM 6,480 total interest
- 3 years: RM 939/month, RM 3,804 total interest
- Difference: RM 2,676 saved

## When Licensed Lenders Make Sense (Despite Higher Rates)

We get it — 14% sounds expensive compared to 8%. But sometimes the higher rate is worth it:

### 1. You Need Money Fast
Banks take 1-2 weeks for approval. Licensed lenders can approve and disburse in 24-48 hours. If you need funds urgently (medical emergency, business opportunity), speed matters more than rate.

### 2. Banks Keep Rejecting You
If you've been rejected by 2-3 banks, stop applying. Each rejection hurts your credit score. Move to licensed lenders with more flexible criteria.

### 3. You're Self-Employed or Freelance
Banks don't like irregular income. Licensed lenders understand gig work, freelancing, and small business cashflow better.

### 4. You Have a Plan to Pay It Off Early
Most personal loans allow early settlement without penalty. Borrow from a licensed lender, solve your immediate problem, then refinance with a bank later when your credit improves.

## Common Questions About Personal Loan Interest Rates

### How do I calculate total interest paid?
Use this formula:
**Total Interest = (Monthly Payment × Number of Months) - Loan Amount**

Example: RM 50,000 loan, RM 1,200/month, 60 months
- Total paid: RM 1,200 × 60 = RM 72,000
- Principal: RM 50,000
- Interest: RM 72,000 - RM 50,000 = RM 22,000

### Can I negotiate interest rates with banks?
Yes, especially if:
- You have multiple offers
- You're an existing customer with good history
- You're borrowing a large amount
- You have excellent credit

### What's a "flat rate" vs "reducing balance" rate?
**Flat rate:** Interest calculated on original loan amount throughout the term. Higher total interest.

**Reducing balance:** Interest calculated on remaining principal. Lower total interest. Most Malaysian personal loans use this.

A 10% flat rate actually costs you roughly 18-20% effective interest rate.

### Do personal loan rates include fees?
Advertised rates are interest only. Add:
- Stamp duty (RM 5-10 per RM 1,000 borrowed)
- Processing fees (0.5% - 1% of loan amount)
- Some lenders charge insurance premiums

Always ask for "total cost of borrowing" not just interest rate.

### Can I refinance my personal loan to get a lower rate?
Yes, if your credit has improved since you first borrowed. Requirements:
- Usually need to wait 6-12 months after original loan
- New bank might have minimum loan amounts
- Calculate if savings outweigh new processing fees

## The Bottom Line: Rate Shopping vs. Getting Approved

Here's the paradox: Chasing the absolute lowest rate can backfire.

Every loan application triggers a credit inquiry. Too many inquiries in a short time signal desperation and hurt your score. That 0.5% rate difference you're chasing might cost you a rejection.

**Smarter approach:**
1. Check your CTOS score
2. Target lenders appropriate for your profile
3. Apply to 2-3 lenders maximum
4. Take the best approved offer

Getting approved at 9% beats getting rejected at "from 6%."
