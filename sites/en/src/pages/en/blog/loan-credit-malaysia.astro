# Loan Credit Malaysia: How Your Credit Score Affects Equipment Financing

Been rejected by a bank because of your credit score? You're not alone. Malaysian SMEs face this every day — good business, solid revenue, but one late payment years ago and suddenly you're "high risk."

Here's what banks don't tell you: credit matters, but it's not the whole story. Let's break down how your loan credit actually affects equipment financing — and what you can do about it.

## What Is Loan Credit in Malaysia?

When we talk about "loan credit" in Malaysia, we're usually referring to two things:

### CCRIS (Central Credit Reference Information System)
- Maintained by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM)
- Shows all your loan repayment history with banks
- Includes credit cards, personal loans, hire purchase, mortgages
- FREE for you to check (any BNM branch or myBNM portal)

### CTOS (CTOS Data Systems Sdn Bhd)
- Private credit reporting agency
- Shows more comprehensive credit information
- Includes trade references, utility bills, legal cases
- Banks and lenders use both CCRIS and CTOS

**The difference:** CCRIS focuses on bank loans. CTOS includes everything else — telco bills, trade suppliers, court judgments.

## How Lenders Use Your Credit Score

Banks are strict. If they see:
- Missed payments in the last 12 months
- High credit utilization (>70% of credit limit)
- Multiple recent loan applications
- Existing commitments >60% of income

→ Automatic rejection. No discussion.

Equipment financing companies look at the bigger picture:

| What We Look At | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Your business revenue | Shows ability to repay |
| Equipment value | Collateral security |
| Industry experience | You know what you're doing |
| Credit history | Context matters — one late payment ≠ bad borrower |

**Real example:** A construction company owner missed two personal loan payments during the COVID lockdown. Banks rejected his excavator financing application. We approved it — because his business was back on track, the excavator was for an active project, and the equipment itself was valuable collateral.

## Common Credit Issues (And How We Handle Them)

### Issue #1: Late Payments on Personal Loans

**The problem:** You missed a few personal loan payments years ago. Banks see "delinquent borrower."

**What we consider:**
- Was this during a genuine hardship (Covid, illness)?
- Have you caught up since?
- Is your business now stable?

**Verdict:** If you're back on track, this doesn't disqualify you. We look at current repayment capacity, not ancient history.

### Issue #2: High Credit Card Utilization

**The problem:** You're maxing out your credit cards every month. Banks see "over-leveraged."

**What we consider:**
- Are you using cards for business expenses?
- Do you pay them off monthly (just utilizing for cash flow)?
- Is your business revenue sufficient to handle both card payments AND equipment financing?

**Verdict:** If cards are for business cash flow (not overspending), this is manageable. We'll look at your business P&L, not just credit utilization.

### Issue #3: Multiple Existing Loans

**The problem:** You have 3-4 active loans. Banks say "too much debt."

**What we consider:**
- Are all loans performing (no missed payments)?
- Will the new equipment generate revenue to service the loan?
- What's your debt service ratio (DSR)?

**Verdict:** If your DSR is reasonable and the equipment financing is for revenue-generating assets, this can work.

### Issue #4: Bankruptcy or Legal Cases

**The problem:** You've been sued or declared bankrupt in the past.

**What we consider:**
- Is the bankruptcy discharged?
- Was it business-related or personal?
- How long ago?

**Verdict:** Discharged bankruptcy (especially >2 years ago) doesn't automatically disqualify you. Every case is different — we'll discuss openly.

## What Lenders REALLY Look For

Beyond credit scores, here's what gets you approved:

### 1. Equipment Quality
- Is the equipment new or used?
- What's its resale value?
- Is it standard equipment (easy to sell) or specialized (harder to move)?

**Why it matters:** Equipment is collateral. Higher value = lower risk for us = better terms for you.

### 2. Business Stability
- How long in business?
- Consistent revenue over past 2 years?
- Active contracts or projects?

**Why it matters:** A 5-year-old business with RM500k monthly revenue > 1-year-old startup with RM50k monthly revenue — even if the startup has perfect credit.

### 3. Down Payment
- Can you put down 10-20%?
- Shows commitment and skin in the game

**Why it matters:** Lower our risk = better chance of approval + better interest rate.

### 4. Clear Purpose
- Is this for an active project or contract?
- Do you have a signed PO or letter of award?

**Why it matters:** Equipment tied to guaranteed revenue = more confident approval.

## How to Check Your Credit Score

### Step 1: Get Your CCRIS Report
1. Go to any Bank Negara Malaysia branch
2. Bring your MyKad
3. Request your CCRIS report
4. It's FREE — takes about 2 weeks

**Or use myBNM portal:** Faster (instant), but you'll need a digital MyKad.

### Step 2: Get Your CTOS Report
1. Visit ctos.com.my
2. Register for a CTOS ID
3. Purchase your report (RM25-50)
4. Get it instantly online

### Step 3: Review for Errors
Look for:
- Loans that aren't yours (identity theft)
- Paid loans still showing as "outstanding"
- Wrong amounts or dates

**If you find errors:** File a dispute with the respective bank or credit bureau. It can take 30-60 days to fix.

## Before You Apply: Improve Your Chances

### 1. Fix Obvious Errors First
If your CCRIS shows a loan you never took, fix it BEFORE applying. This saves everyone time.

### 2. Pay Down High-Interest Debt First
Credit cards at 18-24%? Pay them down before applying for equipment financing. It improves your DSR.

### 3. Avoid New Loan Applications
Each application shows up on your credit report. Multiple applications in 3 months = red flag.

### 4. Prepare Your Documents
Have these ready:
- Latest 6 months bank statements
- Latest audited accounts or tax returns
- SSM registration
- Equipment quotation
- Project contracts or letters of award (if applicable)

### 5. Be Honest About Your Situation
If you have credit issues, mention them upfront. We can work with known problems. We can't work with surprises.

## Bank vs Equipment Financing: Credit Requirements

| Requirement | Banks | Equipment Financing Companies |
|-------------|-------|------------------------------|
| CCRIS clean | Required | Flexible |
| Credit score | Strict cutoffs | Case-by-case |
| Age of business | Usually 3+ years | Can be 1+ years |
| Income verification | Strict | Flexible |
| Down payment | 20-40% | 0-20% |
| Approval time | 3-7 days | 1-3 days |

**The reality:** Banks are great if you have perfect credit and meet all their criteria. Equipment financing companies fill the gap for everyone else.

## What About "No Credit Check" Loans?

You'll see ads promising "no credit check" or "guaranteed approval." Here's the truth:

**Legitimate lenders DO check credit.** Because we're lending money, we need to know you can repay.

**What "flexible credit" actually means:**
- We don't reject you for minor issues
- We consider your business situation, not just a score
- We look at the big picture

**What "no credit check" usually means:**
- Loan sharks (illegal)
- Extremely high interest rates (20-30%+)
- Short tenure (6-12 months) = high monthly payments
- Aggressive collection practices

Avoid these. A legitimate licensed lender will check your credit — they just won't be unreasonable about it.

## Real Stories: SMEs Who Got Approved Despite Credit Issues

### Case #1: The Late Payment During COVID
**Situation:** Construction company missed 3 hire purchase payments during the 2021 lockdown. Business recovered in 2022-2023.

**Banks:** Rejected — "adverse credit history."

**Our assessment:** Business is back on track, equipment is for confirmed project, owner has 20 years industry experience.

**Outcome:** Approved, 5-year hire purchase, 10% down payment.

### Case #2: High Credit Utilization
**Situation:** Trading company using 90% of credit limit for business cash flow. Never missed a payment.

**Banks:** Rejected — "over-leveraged."

**Our assessment:** Revenue supports the debt, credit cards are for working capital, not overspending.

**Outcome:** Approved for lorry financing, 15% down payment.

### Case #3: Discharged Bankruptcy
**Situation:** Owner declared personal bankruptcy in 2018 due to failed restaurant. Discharged in 2021. Started new logistics business in 2022.

**Banks:** Rejected — "bankruptcy history."

**Our assessment:** Different business (logistics vs restaurant), bankruptcy discharged 3+ years ago, new business has contracts.

**Outcome:** Approved for fleet financing (3 lorries), 20% down payment.

## FAQ: Credit and Equipment Financing

### Will checking my credit score lower it?
No. Soft inquiries (you checking yourself) don't affect your score. Only hard inquiries (lender checks when you apply) do.

### How long do negative items stay on my credit report?
- Late payments: 12 months (CCRIS)
- Court judgments: Until settled or discharged
- Bankruptcy: Until discharged (can appear for years after)
- CTOS records: Varies, typically 5-7 years

### Can I get equipment financing with no credit history?
Yes, if you're a new business. We'll look at your industry experience, equipment value, and business plan instead.

### Do I need a guarantor if my credit is poor?
Not always. But having a guarantor (especially with good credit) can improve your chances and get you better terms.

### What's the minimum credit score for approval?
There's no fixed number. We assess your full situation — business revenue, equipment value, industry experience, and credit history together.

### Can I still get approved if I have active legal cases?
It depends. Active litigation doesn't automatically disqualify you — we'll assess the case details and how it affects your business.

### How long does approval take?
Typically 1-3 working days. Complex cases (discharged bankruptcy, multiple issues) may take longer as we review thoroughly.

## Our Take: What We Look For

We've been in equipment financing for 40+ years. We've seen every credit situation imaginable. Here's our philosophy:

**Businesses grow and evolve.** A startup in 2022 is a different company in 2025. We look at where you are now, not just where you were.

**Credit is one piece of the puzzle.** Your business stability, equipment value, and industry experience matter just as much.

**Honesty goes a long way.** Tell us about your credit issues upfront. We'll work with you. Surprises waste everyone's time.
