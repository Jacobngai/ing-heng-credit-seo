# Construction Equipment Financing - SME Startup 2026

## Banks Don't Support SME Startups Well

When SMEs want to start construction businesses, banks require 10-20% down payment. They only finance 90% of equipment value.

For startup equipment costing RM 100,000, banks want RM 10,000 to RM 20,000 down. New SMEs often don't have this cash.

Banks also reject equipment older than 5 years and have strict requirements for new businesses.

Our rates compete with bank rates of 4.6% to 6.0% per year. We welcome SME startups.
