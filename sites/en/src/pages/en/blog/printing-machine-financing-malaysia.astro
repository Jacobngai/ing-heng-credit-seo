# Printing Machine Financing Malaysia: 0% Deposit & 48-Hour Approval

Running a printing business in Malaysia means you're always racing against deadlines. Whether it's a last-minute CNY hamper tag order, a government tender for textbooks, or a massive billboard for a new property launch in Mont Kiara, your machines need to keep humming.

But let’s be honest: a high-end Heidelberg offset press or a late-model Roland large-format printer doesn't come cheap. If you're a growing SME, dropping RM200,000 to RM500,000 in cash upfront can cripple your cash flow.

That's where printing machine financing comes in. At Ing Heng Credit, we've helped Malaysian printers for over 40 years to get the equipment they need without the "bank headache."

## Why Finance Your Printing Machine Instead of Buying Cash?

In the printing world, cash is king. You need it for paper stock, ink, labor, and electricity. Tying up all your capital in a single machine is risky.

1.  **Preserve Your Cash Flow:** Keep your cash for daily operations and emergency repairs.
2.  **Tax Benefits:** Under LHDN guidelines, you can often claim Capital Allowances (CA) on financed machinery, reducing your taxable income.
3.  **Upgrade Faster:** Don't get stuck with an obsolete digital press. Financing makes it easier to upgrade to the latest technology every 3-5 years.
4.  **Beat Inflation:** Lock in your payments now. As prices for machinery rise, your installments stay the same.

## 0% Deposit Financing: Is It Real?

Yes. While most traditional banks in Malaysia demand a 10% to 20% down payment, we understand that for a small printing shop, that initial RM50,000 could be better spent on marketing or moving to a larger shop lot in Balakong or Kepong.

We offer high-margin financing (up to 100%) for qualified businesses. This means you can get the machine on your floor and start generating revenue *before* you've even made your first full payment.

## Types of Printing Equipment We Finance

We don't just look at the brand; we look at the business potential. We finance both new and used (up to 10 years old) machinery, including:

*   **Offset Printing Presses:** Heidelberg, Komori, Ryobi, and Manroland.
*   **Digital Presses:** HP Indigo, Xerox, Konica Minolta, and Ricoh.
*   **Large Format Printers:** Roland, Mimaki, Epson, and Mutoh.
*   **Finishing Equipment:** Folding machines, paper cutters (Polar), laminators, and die-cutting machines.
*   **CTP (Computer-to-Plate) Systems:** Kodak, Agfa, and Screen.

## The "Uncle" Guide to Getting Approved in 48 Hours

We know banks can be slow. They ask for three years of audited accounts, five years of projections, and then take a month to say "no" because your industry is "high risk."

We take a different approach. As your "trusted uncle" in finance, we look at your actual business volume and your experience. Here is the checklist to get your approval moving fast:

| Document Needed | Why We Need It |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SSM (Complete Set)** | To verify your business registration and directors. |
| **6 Months Bank Statements** | To see your actual cash flow and sales volume. |
| **IC of Directors** | Standard KYC requirement in Malaysia. |
| **Machine Quotation** | From your supplier so we know exactly what you're buying. |

**Pro Tip:** If you're buying a used machine from another printer, get a valuation or a clear set of photos showing the machine's condition. This helps us speed up the process.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. I’ve only been in business for one year. Can I apply?
Yes. While banks usually want 3 years of track record, we support young SMEs. If you can show a steady 6 months of bank statements and have a solid customer base, we can talk.

### 2. What is the interest rate?
Rates vary based on the machine type and your business profile. However, we pride ourselves on being transparent — no hidden "processing fees" or "document charges" that surprise you at the end.

### 3. How long is the repayment period?
Typically, printing machine financing terms range from 3 to 5 years (36 to 60 months). This aligns with the productive life of the machine.

### 4. What if my CCRIS isn't perfect?
Don't worry. We understand that business owners sometimes have hiccups. We look at the "big picture"—your current business health is more important to us than a late credit card payment from two years ago.
