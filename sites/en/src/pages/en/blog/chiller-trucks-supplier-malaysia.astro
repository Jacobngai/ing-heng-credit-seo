    question: 'How do I find a reliable chiller truck supplier in Malaysia?',

  {
    question: 'Can I get financing for chiller trucks from a supplier?',
    answer: 'While some suppliers offer in-house credit, many businesses prefer working with specialized finance companies like Ing Heng Credit. This often provides more flexible terms and allows you to choose the exact truck and body configuration you need from any supplier while spreading the cost over 3-5 years.'

    question: 'What is the difference between a chiller truck and a freezer truck?',

    <section class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-800">
      <p>
        If you're in the food and beverage, pharmaceutical, or floral industry in Malaysia, you know that the "cold chain" is the backbone of your business. Whether you're delivering fresh Cameron Highlands produce to markets in KL or transporting frozen seafood to Singapore, your choice of refrigerated vehicle matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when you start searching for a <strong>chiller trucks supplier in Malaysia</strong>, you'll quickly realize it's not as simple as buying a standard lorry. There's a lot of specialized technology involved, from the insulation thickness to the reliability of the refrigeration unit.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Look for in a Chiller Truck Supplier</h2>
      <p>
        In our years of helping Malaysian SMEs finance their fleets, we've seen which trucks last and which ones break down in the middle of a heatwave. Here are the three non-negotiables you should look for when evaluating suppliers:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Body Construction Quality</h3>
      <p>
        In Malaysia's 33°C humidity, your truck's insulation has to work overtime. A good supplier will use high-quality GRP (Glass Reinforced Plastic) panels with high-density polyurethane (PU) foam. If the insulation is thin or poorly fitted, your refrigeration unit will run constantly, burning more fuel and wearing out the engine faster.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Refrigeration Unit Brand & Support</h3>
      <p>
        The "fridge" on top of your truck is its most critical component. Most reliable Malaysian suppliers work with established brands like <strong>Thermo King</strong>, <strong>Carrier</strong>, or <strong>Hwa Sung</strong>. Why? Because these brands have service centers all over Malaysia. If your unit fails in Ipoh at 2 AM, you need to know someone can fix it before your cargo spoils.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Customization Options</h3>
      <p>
        Every business is different. Do you need a "dual-temp" body with a partition for both chilled and frozen goods? Do you need a tail-lift for easy loading at supermarkets? A top-tier supplier won't just sell you a standard box; they'll help you configure a truck that fits your specific workflow.
      </p>

      <h2>The Cost Challenge: Why Financing Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Let's be honest—chiller trucks are expensive. A high-quality refrigerated body can add RM30,000 to RM60,000 to the price of a standard lorry chassis. For many growing businesses, paying RM150,000 to RM200,000 cash for a single truck is a huge strain on working capital.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why many owners look for a supplier that offers "package deals." However, we often tell our clients that <strong>separating your vehicle purchase from your financing</strong> can actually save you money.
      </p>

        <h4 class="text-blue-800 font-bold mt-0">Uncle Ing's Advice:</h4>
        <p class="mb-0 text-blue-900">
          "Don't just look at the monthly installment the supplier offers. Ask about the total interest over 5 years. Sometimes, getting your own financing allows you to negotiate a better cash price from the supplier, saving you thousands in the long run."
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Top Locations for Cold Chain Suppliers in Malaysia</h2>
      <p>
        If you're starting your search, most of the major chiller and cold truck body builders are concentrated in industrial hubs like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shah Alam & Klang:</strong> The heart of Malaysia's logistics industry.</li>
        <li><strong>Johor Bahru:</strong> Specifically for businesses handling cross-border cold chain to Singapore.</li>
        <li><strong>Penang:</strong> Serving the northern manufacturing and food processing sectors.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Chiller Truck vs. Cold Truck: Which One Do You Need?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a common question we get when businesses apply for a loan. Using the wrong truck for your goods is a recipe for disaster:
