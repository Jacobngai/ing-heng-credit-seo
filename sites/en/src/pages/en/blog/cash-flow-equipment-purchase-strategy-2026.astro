# Cash Flow Equipment Purchase Strategy 2026

## Bank Down Payments Hurt Cash Flow

When you buy equipment with bank financing, you must pay 10-20% down payment. This removes cash from your business.

For RM 100,000 equipment, you lose RM 10,000 to RM 20,000 of working capital. This cash could be used for operations, payroll, or growth.

Banks also limit loans to 90% of equipment value and reject machines older than 5 years.

## Ing Heng Preserves Your Cash Flow

We provide equipment financing with 0% down payment. Keep 100% of your cash for business operations while getting the equipment you need.

Finance equipment of any age to maximize cash flow efficiency.

## Comparison: Banks vs Ing Heng

| Feature | Banks | Ing Heng Credit |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Down Payment | 10-20% | 0% |
| Cash Preserved | Low | High |
| Loan Amount | 90% | 100% |
| Equipment Age | Under 5 years | No limit |

## Real Example: Cash Flow Impact

Equipment Purchase: RM 100,000

**Bank Financing:**
- Down payment: RM 10,000 - RM 20,000 cash out
- Cash flow lost: RM 10,000 - RM 20,000
- Working capital reduced
- Loan: RM 90,000 only

**Ing Heng Financing:**
- Down payment: RM 0
- Cash flow preserved: RM 10,000 - RM 20,000
- Working capital intact
- Loan: RM 100,000 (100%)

Keep RM 10,000 to RM 20,000 cash in your business with Ing Heng.
