# Tower Crane Rental vs Financing: Which Saves You More Money in Malaysia?

Got a project that needs a tower crane? You're looking at two options: rent one or finance the purchase. Both have their place, but which one saves you money?

Let's break down the real costs with actual Malaysian numbers.

## Quick Cost Comparison

**Rental:**
- RM15,000 - RM25,000 per month
- No upfront capital
- Pay only for duration needed
- Maintenance included

**Financing:**
- RM800,000 - RM2,500,000 purchase price
- Spread over 5-7 years
- Monthly payments: RM13,000 - RM42,000
- You own the asset

So which makes sense for your business?

## When Renting Makes Sense

### Short-Term Projects (Under 18 Months)

If your project timeline is less than 18 months, rental usually wins on pure cost.

**Example:** 12-month condo project
- Rental cost: RM20,000 × 12 = RM240,000
- Financing: RM25,000 × 12 = RM300,000 (still paying after project ends)

You save RM60,000 and avoid the hassle of selling later.

### One-Off Large Projects

Not planning to use the crane after this project? Rental avoids the risk of an idle asset eating up cash.

The math changes if you have continuous projects lined up.

### Testing the Market

First time using a tower crane? Rent first. Learn what capacity you actually need, what maintenance involves, and whether your team can handle operations.

Better to discover problems on a rental than after dropping RM1.5 million.

## When Financing Makes Sense

### Continuous Work (24+ Months of Projects)

Here's where ownership becomes cheaper.

**Breakeven example:**
- Tower crane price: RM1,200,000
- Financing: RM20,000/month (7 years, 6% interest)
- Rental equivalent: RM20,000/month

After 24 months:
- **Rental spent:** RM480,000 (gone forever)
- **Financing spent:** RM480,000 (building equity)

At month 24, financing gives you an asset worth RM900,000+. Rental gives you nothing.

### Back-to-Back Projects

If you're booking projects 18-24 months ahead, ownership pays off fast.

Many of our clients run tower cranes 80-90% of the year. Their per-project cost drops to RM8,000-12,000/month once the crane is paid off.

That's 40-50% cheaper than rental.

### Rental Business Opportunity

Buy one crane, use it 50% of the time, rent it out the other 50%.

Your crane payments get covered by rental income, and you have a crane available whenever you need it.

**Numbers that work:**
- Your projects: 6 months/year
- Rent it out: 5 months/year at RM18,000/month
- Rental income: RM90,000/year
- Covers ~35-40% of your financing costs

### Tax Benefits

Owned cranes qualify for capital allowances — deduct up to 20% of the purchase price in Year 1.

On a RM1.5 million crane, that's RM300,000 in tax deductions first year.

At 24% corporate tax rate, you save RM72,000 in taxes.

Rental payments are deductible too, but you miss the accelerated depreciation benefit.

## Real Cost Breakdown: 5-Year Comparison

Let's run the numbers on a typical 50-ton tower crane for a contractor with steady work.

### Scenario: 3 Years of Continuous Use

**Option 1: Rent**
- Monthly rental: RM22,000
- 36 months: RM792,000
- Maintenance: Included
- **Total spent: RM792,000**
- **Asset owned: RM0**

**Option 2: Finance**
- Purchase price: RM1,400,000
- Down payment (10%): RM140,000
- Financed: RM1,260,000
- Monthly payment: RM22,500 (7 years, 6.5%)
- 36 months paid: RM810,000
- **Total spent: RM810,000**
- **Remaining loan: RM685,000**
- **Asset value: ~RM1,100,000**
- **Net position: +RM415,000 equity**

After 3 years, financing puts you RM415,000 ahead.

### But What If Work Stops?

This is the rental advantage. If projects dry up, you stop renting. No monthly payments, no idle asset.

With financing, payments continue whether the crane works or not.

**Risk mitigation:**
- Have 6-12 months of booked projects before financing
- Build a reserve fund (3-6 months of payments)
- Consider rental insurance for the crane during idle periods

## Hidden Costs to Consider

### Financing Adds:
- **Maintenance:** RM3,000-6,000/month (major services)
- **Insurance:** RM12,000-18,000/year
- **Operator:** If crane package doesn't include one
- **Storage:** When not in use
- **Certification:** Annual inspections, DOSH compliance

These can add RM5,000-8,000/month to your true cost of ownership.

### Rental Adds:
- **Mobilization:** RM15,000-30,000 each setup
- **Demobilization:** RM10,000-20,000
- **Idle days:** Still charged during weather delays, permit delays
- **Damage excess:** If something breaks

Typical rental contracts charge for transport, setup, and dismantling separately.

## The Hybrid Approach

Many contractors do both:
- **Own** 1-2 cranes for consistent capacity
- **Rent** additional cranes for peak demand

This gives you:
- Lower per-project costs on your owned equipment
- Flexibility to scale up without huge capital outlay
- Backup if your crane needs major service

## How to Decide: 4 Questions

**1. How many months per year will you use the crane?**
- Under 12 months → Rent
- 12-18 months → Break-even zone, consider cash flow
- 18+ months → Finance usually wins

**2. What's your project pipeline?**
- One-off project → Rent
- Steady bookings 12+ months ahead → Finance

**3. Can you handle maintenance?**
- Have in-house mechanics → Finance
- No technical team → Rent (maintenance included)

**4. What's your working capital situation?**
- Cash-tight → Rent (no upfront cost)
- Strong cash reserves → Finance (build equity)
