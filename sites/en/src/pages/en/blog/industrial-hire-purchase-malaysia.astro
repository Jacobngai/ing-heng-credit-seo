      <h2>What is Hire Purchase?</h2>

      <p>Hire purchase is a financing arrangement. You hire equipment with option to buy. Fixed monthly payments. At the end of term, you own it. Simple. Popular in Malaysia for industrial equipment. Manufacturing. Construction. Commercial vehicles. Warehouse equipment. Hire purchase bridges gap between need and ownership.</p>

      <p>Unlike traditional loans, the equipment itself is security. This makes approval easier. You get the equipment now. Pay over time. Own it at the end. That's industrial hire purchase Malaysia in a nutshell.</p>

      <h2>How Hire Purchase Works in Malaysia</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose equipment needed for business</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply for hire purchase financing</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Deposit can be 0-20% (we offer 0% down payment)</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Take possession of equipment immediately</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Make fixed monthly payments over agreed term (typically 3-7 years)</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> At term end, pay small nominal fee and own equipment outright</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Equipment remains property of financier until final payment. But you control and use it fully. You maintain it. You profit from it. At the end, it's yours. Clear ownership transfer.</p>

      <h2>Tax Benefits: Capital Allowance</h2>

      <p>Industrial hire purchase Malaysia offers significant tax advantages. Capital allowance allows you to deduct equipment cost from taxable income. Over time, this reduces tax liability. Section 19 of Income Tax Act 1967 governs this.</p>

      <p><strong>Capital Allowance Rates:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Industrial building:</strong> 10% per year (initial + annual)</li>
        <li><strong>Plant and machinery:</strong> 20% per year</li>
        <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> 20% per year</li>
        <li><strong>Motor vehicles:</strong> 20% per year (max RM50,000 deduction/year)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example: Purchase RM200,000 manufacturing machine via hire purchase. Annual capital allowance: RM40,000 (20%). If tax rate is 24%, you save RM9,600 in taxes each year. Over 5 years, that's RM48,000 in tax savings. Real money.</p>

      <h2>Key Benefits of Industrial Hire Purchase</h2>

      <h3>1. Fixed Monthly Payments</h3>
      <p>Budget with certainty. No surprises. Payment amount stays same entire term. Easy cash flow planning. Inflation doesn't increase your payment. Predictable business operations.</p>

      <h3>2. Asset Ownership at End</h3>
      <p>Unlike leasing, you end up owning equipment. Build business assets. Residual value belongs to you. Sell or upgrade later. Your equity grows over time.</p>

      <h3>3. 100% Financing Available</h3>
      <p>Some financiers require down payment. We offer 0% down payment. Keep your cash. Use it for operations, inventory, or growth. No need to tie up capital upfront.</p>

      <h3>4. Lower Monthly Payments</h3>
      <p>Spread cost over years. Monthly payments are manageable. Cash flow stays healthy. Equipment generates income while you pay. Self-financing purchase.</p>

      <h3>5. No Collateral Needed</h3>
      <p>Equipment itself is security. No need to pledge property or other assets. Protects your business. Fast approval process. Less paperwork.</p>
