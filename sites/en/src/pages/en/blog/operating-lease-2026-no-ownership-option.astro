# Operating Lease 2026 - No Ownership Option

Operating Lease offers equipment use without ownership. Here's what Malaysian businesses need to know in 2026.

## What is Operating Lease?

Operating Lease means:
- Rent equipment monthly
- No ownership at end
- Return or upgrade option
- Lower monthly commitment

## Operating Lease vs Hire Purchase 2026

| Feature | Operating Lease | Hire Purchase |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Ownership** | No | Yes (after payment) |
| **Down Payment** | 0% | 0-20% |
| **Monthly Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Contract Term** | 1-5 years | 3-7 years |
| **Equipment Age** | New preferred | Any age OK |
| **Tax Benefit** | Full deductible | Interest deductible |

## Real Example: Forklift

**Price:** RM 45,000

**Operating Lease (3 years):**
- Monthly: RM 1,200
- Total paid: RM 43,200
- Ownership: No (return or renew)

**Hire Purchase (5 years):**
- Monthly: RM 900
- Total paid: RM 54,000
- Ownership: Yes after final payment

## Who Should Choose Operating Lease?

**Best for:**
- Short-term projects (1-2 years)
- Seasonal demand businesses
- Testing equipment before buying
- Wanting regular equipment upgrades
- Prefer off-balance-sheet financing

**Industries:**
- Peak season logistics
- Construction tender projects
- Event management companies
- Warehouse expansion testing

## 2026 Operating Lease Benefits

1. **Lower Monthly** - Less commitment than HP
2. **Flexible Terms** - 1-5 year options
3. **Easy Upgrade** - Switch to newer models
4. **No Ownership Risk** - Return anytime
5. **Tax Efficient** - Full lease payment deductible
