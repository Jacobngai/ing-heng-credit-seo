    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">What is Business Capital?</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Business capital is the money your company uses to operate and grow. Working capital covers daily expenses like wages, rent, utilities, and inventory. Fixed capital goes into long-term assets like machinery, vehicles, and equipment.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      For SMEs in Malaysia, the challenge isn't just finding capital—it's finding the <strong>right kind</strong> of capital. A loan that drains your cash flow with high monthly payments doesn't help. Financing that preserves working capital while acquiring revenue-generating equipment does.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">The Capital Trap: How Traditional Loans Drain SMEs</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Here's a scenario we see constantly. A construction company needs an excavator. Price: RM300,000. The bank approves the loan but requires 30% down payment. That's RM90,000 upfront.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      That RM90,000 comes from somewhere—usually from the business's working capital. Now the company has the excavator but depleted cash reserves. When the next month's bills arrive—payroll, material costs, supplier payments—there's not enough cash. The business is asset-rich but cash-poor.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      This is the capital trap. You acquire equipment to grow, but the cost of acquiring it hampers growth. The solution is financing that minimizes upfront cash outlay while spreading costs over manageable terms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">Types of Business Capital Loans in Malaysia</h2>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3 mt-6">Equipment Financing</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Equipment financing uses the machinery or vehicle you're purchasing as security. This is ideal for SMEs because the loan is backed by a productive asset—not by your cash flow alone.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>Equipment we finance:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
      <li>Excavators, bulldozers, backhoes (construction)</li>
      <li>Lorries, trucks, prime movers (logistics)</li>
      <li>Forklifts, reach trucks, pallet jacks (warehousing)</li>
      <li>CNC machines, lathes, presses (manufacturing)</li>
      <li>Commercial kitchen equipment (F&B)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3 mt-6">Hire Purchase</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Hire purchase is Malaysia's most common business financing structure. You make fixed monthly payments over a set term (3-5 years typically). At the end of the term, you own the equipment outright.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>Key advantage:</strong> You can claim capital allowance on the equipment for tax purposes. Interest payments are also tax-deductible business expenses.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3 mt-6">Operating Lease</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Operating lease is like long-term rental. You make monthly payments for equipment use, but don't own it at term end. This works well for equipment that becomes obsolete quickly or is needed only for specific projects.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>Key advantage:</strong> Lease payments are fully tax-deductible operating expenses. No depreciation calculations required.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">Why 0% Down Payment Matters for SME Capital</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      The difference between 0% down and 30% down isn't just RM90,000 on a RM300,000 excavator. It's what that RM90,000 represents for a growing SME.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      RM90,000 could mean:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>2 months of payroll for 10 employees</li>
      <li>Initial material purchase for a RM500,000 contract</li>
      <li>Down payment on a second piece of equipment</li>
      <li>Buffer for 3-4 months of operations</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-900 mb-3">The Opportunity Cost of Down Payments</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        When you pay RM90,000 upfront, that capital is gone from your business. It can't earn revenue. It can't cover unexpected expenses. It's trapped in the equipment.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        With 0% down payment financing, that same RM90,000 stays in your business. It works. It generates returns. And the equipment still gets acquired—just financed instead of purchased outright.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Over 5 years, the slightly higher monthly payment (RM130-200 difference on RM300,000 equipment) is often offset by having RM90,000 working capital available from day one.
      </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">Choosing the Right Business Capital Solution</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Not all business capital needs are the same. Here's how to choose the right financing structure:
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3 mt-6">Choose Hire Purchase When:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
      <li>You want to own the equipment long-term</li>
      <li>Equipment has 5+ years of useful life</li>
      <li>Tax deductions through capital allowance matter</li>
      <li>Your business has stable cash flow</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3 mt-6">Choose Operating Lease When:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
      <li>Equipment technology changes rapidly</li>
      <li>You need equipment only for specific projects</li>
      <li>You want to upgrade equipment frequently</li>
      <li>You prefer fully tax-deductible payments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3 mt-6">Choose 0% Down Payment When:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-1">
      <li>Working capital is tight</li>
      <li>You need to preserve cash for operations</li>
      <li>You're starting a new business</li>
      <li>You're purchasing multiple pieces of equipment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">SME-Specific Business Capital Challenges in Malaysia</h2>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3 mt-6">Contractor Payment Delays</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Government and corporate contracts often pay on milestone basis—Net-30, Net-60, sometimes Net-90 days after work completion. During this gap, your business still operates. Employees need wages. Materials need purchasing. Equipment needs fuel.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Business capital financing with 0% down payment preserves cash to bridge these payment gaps. You have working capital available while waiting for contract payments.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3 mt-6">Seasonal Cash Flow Variations</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Malaysian SMEs face seasonal fluctuations. Construction slows during monsoon. Retail peaks during festive seasons. Tourism fluctuates with school holidays.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Traditional bank loans don't account for this—fixed monthly payments regardless of revenue. Flexible financing structures align payments with your business cycles.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3 mt-6">Equipment Age Restrictions</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Banks typically won't finance equipment older than 5-10 years. But for many SMEs, well-maintained used equipment is the sensible choice—40-60% cheaper than new, still plenty of useful life remaining.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Private equipment financing often has no age restrictions. A 7-year-old Komatsu excavator in good condition can be financed, allowing you to acquire productive equipment at a fraction of new equipment cost.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">FAQ: Business Capital Loan Malaysia</h2>

    <div class="space-y-6 my-8">
      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-2">What's the minimum business age to qualify?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Most lenders require at least 1 year of business operation. New businesses may qualify with strong business plan, personal guarantors, or collateral. We evaluate each case individually—your equipment matters more than just business age.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-2">How much down payment is required?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Traditional banks typically require 20-40% down payment. Equipment financing specialists like Ing Heng Credit offer 0% down payment options for qualified applicants. This preserves your working capital for operations instead of tying it up in equipment deposits.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-2">What interest rates can I expect?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Rates vary based on equipment type, loan amount, term, and your business profile. Construction equipment typically ranges 7.5-10%, commercial vehicles 8-11%, and specialized equipment 9-12%. The best way to get accurate rates is to request a free quotation based on your specific needs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-2">Can I finance used equipment?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Yes! Private equipment financing specialists often finance used equipment of any age, provided it's in good working condition. Banks typically restrict equipment age to 5-10 years. Used equipment financing allows you to acquire reliable machinery at 40-60% lower cost than new.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-2">How long is the approval process?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Approval times vary by lender and deal complexity. Private equipment financing specialists typically approve in days to 1 week, compared to banks which may take 2-4 weeks. Fast approval means your business gets equipment sooner and starts generating revenue faster.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-2">What documents do I need?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Typical requirements: SSM registration certificate, bank statements (6 months), business management accounts, equipment quotation or invoice, business address proof (utility bills or rental agreement), and CIDB/MBAM registration for construction businesses. Additional documents may be requested based on your specific situation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-2">Can early settlement reduce total cost?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Yes, many financing agreements allow early settlement with reduced interest. If your business generates stronger-than-expected revenue, you can pay off the loan early and save on interest. Check the terms of your specific agreement for early settlement policies.
        </p>
