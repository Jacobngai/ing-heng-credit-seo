    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Your cold chain business needs reliability. A chiller truck isn't just a vehicle — it's the heart of your operation. But let's be honest, paying RM 200,000+ upfront for a new unit? That's tough for most Malaysian SMEs.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
      That's where chiller truck financing comes in. We help you spread the cost over 3-5 years while keeping your working capital where it belongs — running your business, not sitting in a truck.

      What's the Difference Between Chiller and Refrigerated Trucks?
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Before diving into financing, let's clear something up. Many people use "chiller truck" and "refrigerated truck" interchangeably, but there's a difference that matters for your business.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Chiller Trucks
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Chiller trucks maintain temperatures between 0°C to 5°C. Perfect for:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Fresh dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese)</li>
      <li>Fresh fruits and vegetables</li>
      <li>Beverages (juice, soft drinks, beer)</li>
      <li>Baked goods and confectionery</li>
      <li>Fresh meat and seafood (short duration)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Refrigerated (Freezer) Trucks
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Freezer trucks go down to -18°C or lower. Essential for:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Frozen foods and ice cream</li>
      <li>Long-term meat and seafood storage</li>
      <li>Pharmaceutical products</li>
      <li>Ice and frozen desserts</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
      Knowing which type you need affects your financing choice. A chiller truck is usually cheaper than a full freezer truck, but the right choice depends on what you're transporting.
    </p>

      Chiller Truck Financing Options in Malaysia
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      At Ing Heng Credit, we understand Malaysian businesses. Different companies have different needs. Here's what we offer:
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Hire Purchase
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      The traditional choice for most Malaysian SMEs. Here's how it works:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> Usually 10-20% of truck price</li>
      <li><strong>Repayment period:</strong> 3-5 years (up to 7 years for qualified borrowers)</li>
      <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> You own the truck after final payment</li>
      <li><strong>Interest rates:</strong> Fixed rate, so your monthly payments stay the same</li>
      <li><strong>Tax benefits:</strong> Interest payments are tax-deductible</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      <strong>Good for:</strong> Businesses that want ownership at the end, predictable monthly payments, and tax deductibility.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Operating Lease
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      More like renting, but for the long term:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> Minimal or zero</li>
      <li><strong>Repayment period:</strong> Typically 2-5 years</li>
      <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> You don't own the truck at the end</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly payments:</strong> Often lower than hire purchase</li>
      <li><strong>Tax benefits:</strong> Lease payments are fully tax-deductible as operating expenses</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      <strong>Good for:</strong> Businesses that prefer lower monthly payments, want to upgrade trucks every few years, or prefer to treat it as a fully deductible operating expense.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Zero Down Payment Options
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      We know cash is king. That's why we offer options that require zero down payment:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Keep your cash for operations, inventory, and growth</li>
      <li>Ideal for startups and expanding businesses</li>
      <li>Slightly higher monthly payments, but no upfront cost</li>
      <li>Available for qualified borrowers with good business track record</li>
    </ul>

      Tips for Choosing the Right Chiller Truck
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Before you commit to financing, make sure you're choosing the right truck for your needs:
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Match Capacity to Demand
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Don't oversize. A larger truck costs more to buy, more to operate, and you're paying for empty space most of the time. On the other hand, too small means multiple trips and wasted fuel. Look at your average delivery volume, not your peak volume.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Check the Refrigeration Unit
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      The refrigeration unit is as important as the truck itself. Thermo King and Carrier are premium brands that offer better reliability and resale value. Make sure the unit matches your temperature requirements.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Consider Maintenance Costs
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Different brands have different maintenance costs. Isuzu and Hino are known for lower maintenance. Thermo King and Carrier have better support networks. Do your research before committing.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      New vs Used
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      New trucks come with warranty, lower maintenance (initially), and better financing rates. Used trucks are cheaper upfront but may have higher maintenance costs. Consider your risk tolerance and budget.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Frequently Asked Questions
    </h2>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      How long does approval take?
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Most approvals happen within 48 hours. Some straightforward cases can be approved on the same day. Complex cases may take 3-5 days. We move faster than banks because we have our own decision-making authority — we don't need to send your application to headquarters in another country.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      What if I have bad credit?
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      We look at the full picture. Bad credit doesn't automatically mean rejection. We consider your business history, industry, cash flow, and the reason for the credit issues. We've approved many clients who were rejected by banks.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Can I finance a used chiller truck?
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Yes, we finance used trucks. The truck must be in good condition, and we'll typically finance up to 80-90% of the market value. Interest rates may be slightly higher than new trucks.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Can I refinance my existing chiller truck?
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Yes, if you have equity in the truck, we can refinance to pull out cash for your business. This is useful when you need working capital but don't want to sell your truck.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      What's the minimum down payment?
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Standard is 10-20%. But we offer zero down payment options for qualified borrowers. Your down payment affects your monthly payment — lower down payment means higher monthly payment.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Can I pay off early?
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Yes, you can pay off early. There may be a small penalty depending on your agreement structure. We'll explain this clearly before you commit. No surprises.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
      Do you finance Thermo King trucks specifically?
    </h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Yes, we finance all refrigeration units including Thermo King, Carrier, Denso, and Mitsubishi. We can also help with upgrading your refrigeration unit on an existing truck chassis.
