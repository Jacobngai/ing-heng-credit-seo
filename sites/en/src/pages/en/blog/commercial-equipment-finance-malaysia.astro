# Commercial Equipment Finance Malaysia: Complete SME Guide

Looking to finance commercial equipment for your business but not sure where to start? You're not alone. Most Malaysian SMEs struggle with the cash flow hit of buying machinery, tools, or vehicles outright.

Commercial equipment finance lets you spread the cost over 3-5 years while keeping your working capital intact. Here's everything you need to know.

## What is Commercial Equipment Finance?

Commercial equipment finance is a loan specifically for business equipment — anything from excavators and forklifts to restaurant ovens and medical devices.

Unlike a business loan that goes into your account, the money goes straight to the supplier. You repay over time while using the equipment to generate income.

### How It Works

1. **Choose your equipment** — New or used, any brand
2. **Apply for financing** — Usually get approval within 48 hours
3. **We pay the supplier** — You don't touch the cash
4. **Repay monthly** — Fixed instalments for 1-7 years

Simple. No need to drain your bank account.

## What Equipment Can You Finance?

Pretty much anything used for business:

**Construction & Heavy Machinery**
- Excavators, bulldozers, cranes
- Cement mixers, compactors
- Scaffolding systems

**Transport & Logistics**
- Lorries, trucks, prime movers
- Forklifts, pallet jacks
- Refrigerated vehicles

**Manufacturing Equipment**
- CNC machines, lathes, presses
- Conveyor systems
- Industrial ovens and dryers

**Food & Beverage**
- Commercial kitchen equipment
- Cold rooms, freezers
- Bakery and processing machines

**Medical & Healthcare**
- Diagnostic equipment
- Dental chairs and tools
- Physiotherapy machines

**Office & Tech**
- Computers, servers
- POS systems
- Security and surveillance

If it's used to run your business, we can likely finance it.

## Commercial Equipment Finance vs. Bank Loans

Here's the honest comparison:

| Feature | Ing Heng Credit | Banks |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **Down Payment** | 0% possible | 20-40% required |
| **Equipment Age** | Any age accepted | Won't finance >10 years old |
| **Approval Time** | 24-48 hours | 1-2 weeks minimum |
| **Credit Requirements** | Flexible | Strict |
| **Age Limit** | None | Often stop at 55-60 |
| **Processing** | Straightforward | Complicated paperwork |

Banks are great if you have perfect credit and time to spare. For most SMEs, equipment financiers move faster and ask for less.

## Why Finance Instead of Buying Cash?

**1. Keep Cash Flow Healthy**
A RM80,000 excavator paid cash is RM80,000 gone. Financed? Maybe RM1,500/month. That's a massive difference when you need cash for payroll, materials, or emergencies.

**2. Tax Benefits**
Lease payments are tax-deductible. If you purchase, you claim capital allowances over time. Either way, financing gives you flexibility.

**3. Upgrade Without Pain**
Equipment gets outdated. Financing lets you upgrade every few years without a huge cash hit.

**4. Use OPM (Other People's Money)**
Your RM1,500/month payment is covered by revenue from the equipment. The equipment pays for itself.

## Real-World Example: SME Construction Company

**Business:** Small contractor in Selangor  
**Need:** 2 excavators to win larger tenders  
**Cost:** RM160,000 (RM80,000 each)  
**Cash on hand:** RM50,000

### Option 1: Pay Cash
Use all RM50,000 + borrow from family. Zero working capital left. Risky.

### Option 2: Bank Loan
RM64,000 down payment (40%). Plus 2 weeks approval time. Tender deadline missed.

### Option 3: Commercial Equipment Finance (Ing Heng)
- RM0 down payment
- Approved in 48 hours
- RM2,400/month over 5 years
- Kept RM50,000 for operations
- Won the tender worth RM300,000

Which would you choose?

## How to Qualify

We're more flexible than banks, but we still need to see:

**Basic Requirements:**
- Malaysian business (Sdn Bhd, Enterprise, sole proprietor)
- Business bank statements (3-6 months)
- Copy of quotation or invoice for equipment
- Owner's NRIC

**What Helps Your Application:**
- Existing customer base
- Equipment will generate revenue
- Clear repayment ability
- Industry experience

**What Doesn't Matter:**
- Your age (we finance retirees)
- Equipment age (10+ years old? No problem)
- Past bank rejections (we evaluate differently)

## Application Process

**Step 1: Get a Quote**
Call or WhatsApp us with your equipment details. We'll give you rough numbers in 10 minutes.

**Step 2: Submit Documents**
Bank statements, quotation, NRIC. That's usually it.

**Step 3: Approval**
Most cases: 24-48 hours. Simple applications can be same-day.

**Step 4: Sign & Collect**
We pay the supplier, you sign the agreement, pick up your equipment.

## Repayment Terms

**Tenure:** 1-7 years (most pick 3-5)  
**Interest Rate:** Depends on amount, tenure, risk  
**Payment:** Fixed monthly instalments

**Early Settlement:** Allowed. No penalty at most financiers (confirm first).

## Common Questions

### Can I finance used equipment?
Yes. Any age, any condition (as long as it works).

### Do I need collateral?
The equipment itself is collateral. Sometimes we ask for director's guarantee.

### What if my credit score is bad?
We look at your business cash flow more than your credit score. Many "bank rejects" get approved.

### Can I finance equipment AND working capital?
Equipment finance is specifically for equipment. But if you have strong cash flow, we can explore options.

### What if the supplier is overseas?
We can finance imported equipment. Just need proper invoices and import docs.
