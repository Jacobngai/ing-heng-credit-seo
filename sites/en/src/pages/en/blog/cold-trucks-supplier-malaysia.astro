    question: 'What is the main difference between a cold truck and a chiller truck?',
    answer: 'A cold truck (or freezer truck) is built to maintain deep-freeze temperatures, usually between -18°C to -25°C, using thicker insulation (100mm+) and more powerful refrigeration units. A chiller truck usually stays between 0°C and 4°C for fresh produce.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does a cold truck body cost in Malaysia?',
    answer: 'A high-quality 10ft to 14ft cold truck body with deep-freeze capabilities typically costs between RM40,000 and RM65,000, not including the truck chassis. The price depends on the insulation thickness and the brand of the refrigeration unit.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance a second-hand cold truck in Malaysia?',

        "In the frozen food business, your truck is your warehouse on wheels. If the temperature drops, your profits melt. Finding the right cold trucks supplier in Malaysia is about more than just a price tag—it's about reliability."
      </p>

    <section class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-800">
      <p>
        If you're running a frozen food business in Malaysia—whether it's frozen seafood, premium ice cream, or halal meat—you know that the "last mile" is the most dangerous part of your journey. One breakdown in the KL traffic jam can result in thousands of Ringgit in spoiled inventory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding a reliable <strong>cold trucks supplier in Malaysia</strong> is a challenge because a "freezer truck" isn't just a regular lorry with an aircon. It requires specialized engineering to maintain temperatures as low as -25°C in our humid 33°C tropical climate.
      </p>

      <h2>Cold Truck vs. Chiller Truck: Don't Make This RM50,000 Mistake</h2>
      <p>
        We often see new business owners getting confused between a chiller and a cold truck. Using the wrong one can be a very expensive mistake.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chiller Trucks (0°C to 4°C):</strong> Best for fruits, vegetables, and milk. The insulation is usually 50mm-75mm thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold Trucks (-18°C to -25°C):</strong> Necessary for frozen meat, seafood, and ice cream. These require 100mm to 125mm thick high-density PU foam insulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you try to use a chiller truck for frozen goods, the refrigeration unit will work 24/7, eventually burning out the compressor and likely failing to keep your goods frozen during long hauls.
      </p>

      <h2>3 Things to Check Before Choosing a Cold Truck Supplier</h2>
      <p>
        As a finance company that has seen hundreds of these trucks on the road, here is the "Uncle Ing" advice on what to look for:
      </p>

      <h3>1. The "Box" Quality (Insulation)</h3>
      <p>
        The body of the truck (the box) is where most of the magic happens. A good supplier will use GRP (Glass Reinforced Plastic) or stainless steel inner liners. But the most important part is the <strong>polyurethane (PU) foam</strong> inside. It must be high-density and injected without gaps. If there are air pockets, your truck will "sweat," leading to mold and lost cooling efficiency.
      </p>

      <h3>2. The Refrigeration Unit (The Heart)</h3>
      <p>
        Don't compromise here. Stick to brands that have a wide service network in Malaysia, such as <strong>Thermo King</strong>, <strong>Carrier</strong>, or <strong>Hwa Sung</strong>. If you are stuck in Ipoh or Melaka with a broken freezer at 3 AM, you want a brand that has a local technician who can come to you immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Floor Construction</h3>
      <p>
        Frozen goods are heavy, and condensation makes floors slippery. Look for a supplier that offers aluminum "T-bar" flooring or corrugated stainless steel. This allows air to circulate *under* your pallets, ensuring the entire load stays at the same temperature.
      </p>

        <h4 class="text-blue-800 font-bold mt-0">A Practical Tip from the Office:</h4>
        <p class="mb-0 text-blue-900">
          "Check the door seals. In Malaysia's humidity, old or poor-quality rubber seals will crack quickly. This lets warm air in and cold air out, making your fuel consumption skyrocket. A good supplier will use multi-layer 'refrigerator-style' gaskets."
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Reality of Cost: RM180,000 and Up</h2>
      <p>
        Let's be blunt—a proper cold truck isn't cheap. A new 1-ton or 3-ton Japanese chassis (like Isuzu or Fuso) plus a high-quality freezer body can easily cost between RM160,000 to RM220,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        For many Malaysian SMEs, paying cash upfront for a fleet of three or four trucks just isn't an option. It drains your working capital that should be used for buying inventory or marketing.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Finance Your Cold Truck Fleet</h2>
      <p>
        At Ing Heng Credit, we specialize in <strong>cold chain financing</strong>. We understand that a refrigerated truck is a specialized asset. While traditional banks might be conservative because the body is "custom," we see the value it brings to your business.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Why SMEs choose us for Cold Truck Loans:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low Deposit Options:</strong> We can often finance up to 85-90% of the total truck + body cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast Approval:</strong> We know that "time is money" in logistics. Most applications are processed within 48 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible for Used Trucks:</strong> If you're buying a second-hand unit from a reputable supplier, we can still provide competitive financing.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Service:</strong> You'll talk to a real person who understands the Malaysian cold chain industry, not just a credit scoring algorithm.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where to Find Suppliers in Malaysia?</h2>
      <p>
        Most of the top-tier cold truck body builders are located in the <strong>Klang Valley</strong> (specifically Shah Alam and North Klang) and <strong>Johor Bahru</strong>. If you are based in East Malaysia, many suppliers in Selangor can coordinate the shipping of the completed truck to Kuching or Kota Kinabalu for you.
