# Heavy Equipment Package - 5+ Units Fleet Deal 2026

## Banks Don't Offer Fleet Deals

When contractors need 5 or more equipment units, banks still require 10-20% down payment on EACH unit. They don't offer special fleet packages.

For 5 excavators at RM 50,000 each (RM 250,000 total), banks want RM 25,000 to RM 50,000 down. No fleet discount.

Banks also reject equipment older than 5 years.

## Ing Heng Offers Fleet Package Deals

We provide heavy equipment package financing with 0% down payment. You get 100% full loan. Special rates for 5+ units.

No age limit on any equipment in your fleet.
