// Comprehensive FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Can I finance industrial quilting machines in Malaysia?',
    answer: 'Yes! We specialize in textile machinery financing including multi-needle quilting machines, long-arm systems, and computerized quilting equipment. We understand the unique requirements of mattress, bedding, and textile manufacturers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of quilting machines can you finance?',
    answer: 'We finance all types including multi-needle quilting machines, single-head systems, long-arm quilting machines, computerized pattern quilting, and ultrasonic quilting systems. Both new imported machines and quality used equipment are considered.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance complete textile production lines?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! We offer production line packages including quilting machine + cutting tables + packaging equipment + material handling systems. Complete setup financing is often more efficient and cost-effective than individual equipment loans.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the typical financing amount for quilting machines?',
    answer: 'Quilting machine financing ranges from RM 80,000 for smaller single-head units to RM 500,000+ for automated multi-needle production systems. Complete production lines can range from RM 300,000 to RM 1,500,000 depending on capacity and automation level.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can textile startups finance quilting equipment?',
    answer: 'Yes, we support new textile businesses with proper business plans, industry experience, and customer contracts. Startup financing may require higher down payment (25-30%) and demonstration of market demand through pre-orders or contracts.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you understand seasonal textile business patterns?',
    answer: 'Yes! We structure payment terms considering textile industry seasonality, Hari Raya bedding demand, Chinese New Year production cycles, and hotel renovation seasons. Flexible payment schedules help manage cash flow during slower periods.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about quilting machine maintenance and training?',
    answer: 'Maintenance contracts and operator training can often be included in quilting machine financing packages. Proper training ensures optimal productivity and machine longevity. We work with suppliers who provide comprehensive support.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance quilting machines for hotel/hospitality supply?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! Many of our clients supply hotels, resorts, and hospitals. Quilting machines for hospitality bedding often require specific quality standards and wash durability. We understand these commercial requirements and financing needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance used quilting machines?',
    answer: 'Yes, quality used quilting machines from reputable suppliers are considered. Used machines must be in good working condition with available parts and service support. We evaluate machine history, maintenance records, and remaining useful life.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does quilting machine financing approval take?',
    answer: 'Standard approval for established textile businesses is fast from complete application. For new businesses or complex production line setups, allow 1-2 weeks for thorough evaluation including equipment assessment and business review.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I trade in my manual quilting equipment?',
    answer: 'Yes! Trade-in programs help offset the cost of upgrading to automated quilting machines. Manual machine value depends on condition and market demand. This reduces down payment requirements for automation upgrades.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents are needed for textile equipment financing?',
    answer: 'Required: Company registration, financial statements (2 years), equipment quotations, business plan, and production requirements. For established textile businesses: customer contracts, production records, and cash flow projections.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance quilting machines for export production?',
    answer: 'Yes, export-oriented textile manufacturers often have stronger financing profiles due to foreign currency earnings. Export contracts and letters of credit strengthen financing applications. We understand export business cash flow patterns.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance multiple quilting machines for expansion?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! Fleet financing available for textile businesses scaling production. Multiple machine purchases often qualify for volume discounts and better financing terms. Ideal for capacity expansion or new production facility setup.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about raw material financing with quilting machines?',
    answer: 'While we focus on equipment financing, working capital for raw materials can sometimes be structured with equipment loans for comprehensive business support. This helps ensure smooth production startup after machine installation.'
  },
