// Comprehensive FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Can I finance used CNC machines?',
    answer: 'Yes! We finance both new and used CNC machines from quality brands like Takisawa, Mazak, Haas, and DMG Mori. Used machines must be in good working condition and from reputable suppliers. We evaluate machine age, condition, maintenance history, and remaining useful life for financing decisions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What CNC machine brands do you finance?',
    answer: 'We finance all major CNC brands including Takisawa, Mazak, Haas, DMG Mori, Okuma, Doosan, Fanuc, Hardinge, Citizen, Star, and others. Both Japanese, American, German, and quality Taiwanese/Korean brands are acceptable. Machine quality and supplier reliability are key factors.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance complete machine shop setups?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! We offer workshop equipment packages including CNC lathe + milling machine + tooling + ancillary equipment in one financing package. This is efficient for new workshops or major upgrades. Package deals often qualify for better rates and terms.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the maximum age for used CNC machine financing?',
    answer: 'We finance CNC machines of any age depending on brand, maintenance, and condition. Well-maintained Takisawa, Mazak, or similar quality machines of any age are considered on case-by-case basis. Key factors are working condition, accuracy, and remaining useful life.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I trade in my old machines?',
    answer: 'Yes, we work with trade-in programs where you can apply your manual or old CNC machine value toward new equipment financing. This reduces down payment requirements and helps modernize your workshop efficiently. Trade-in value depends on machine condition and market demand.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance CNC machine tooling and accessories?',
    answer: 'Yes, tooling, workholding, cutting tools, and accessories can be included in CNC machine financing packages. Complete setup financing including machine + tooling + training + installation is available. This helps get your production running immediately.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the requirements for CNC machine financing?',
    answer: 'For companies: SSM registration, financial statements (2 years), bank statements, equipment quotations, and business plan. For sole proprietors: IC, income proof, bank statements, and equipment requirements. Manufacturing experience or training certification helpful but not mandatory.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does approval take for CNC equipment?',
    answer: 'Standard approval is fast for complete applications. We understand manufacturing urgency and prioritize CNC equipment financing. Equipment evaluation, credit assessment, and documentation can be completed quickly for established manufacturing businesses.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can startups finance CNC machines?',
    answer: 'Yes! We support new manufacturing businesses with proper business plans, industry experience, and customer contracts. Startup financing may require higher down payment (25-30%) or personal guarantees. Strong technical background and business plan are important factors.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance CNC training costs?',
    answer: 'Training costs can sometimes be included in equipment financing packages, especially for new CNC operations. This includes operator training, programming courses, and maintenance training. Proper training ensures equipment productivity and longevity.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if the CNC machine breaks down?',
    answer: 'Equipment insurance is recommended to cover major breakdowns. We can connect you with insurance providers offering manufacturing equipment coverage. Preventive maintenance contracts with suppliers help minimize downtime and protect your investment.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I upgrade CNC machines later?',
    answer: 'Yes! After 12-24 months of good payment history, you can upgrade to newer or larger CNC machines. We offer refinancing options to consolidate existing loans and add new equipment. Many clients grow from single machines to complete CNC workshops.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance imported CNC machines?',
    answer: 'Yes, we finance CNC machines imported directly from manufacturers or authorized dealers. Import documentation, customs clearance, and installation coordination can be included. We work with established importers and ensure proper warranty coverage.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about CNC machine maintenance costs?',
    answer: 'Maintenance costs are separate from financing but should be factored into business planning. Annual maintenance typically costs 8-12% of machine value. We can introduce you to authorized service providers and discuss maintenance financing options.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance multiple CNC machines simultaneously?',
    answer: 'Yes! Fleet financing available for manufacturing businesses expanding operations. Multiple machine packages often qualify for volume discounts and better terms. This is efficient for production scaling or complete workshop modernization.'
  },
