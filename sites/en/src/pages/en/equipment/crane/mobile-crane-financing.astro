We also accept used equipment trade-ins as part of down payment.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What mobile crane models do you finance?',
    answer: 'We finance all major mobile crane models from top brands: Hitachi (CX series, ZX series), Kato (KR series), Kobelco (SK series), Demag (AC series), Liebherr (LTM series), Grove (GM series), and many more.

    answer: 'Standard approval is 24-48 hours from complete document submission. Urgent cases with immediate project deadlines (highway projects, bridge construction, etc.) are processed on priority basis and can receive approval within 12 hours. Fast preliminary approval available via WhatsApp with basic information.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the minimum and maximum mobile crane loan amount?',
    answer: 'Minimum loan: RM 300,000 for 20-ton mobile cranes. Maximum loan: RM 1,200,000 for 80-100 ton mobile cranes. We can finance up to 90% of equipment value with down payments from 0% to 10%. Exact loan amount depends on crane model, age, condition, brand, and your financial profile.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the down payment requirement?',
    answer: 'Down payment from 0% to 10% is available for qualified applicants. For used mobile cranes (5+ years old), we typically require 10-20% down payment. For new cranes, we offer 0% down payment options. For premium brands like Hitachi and Kobelco, better terms may be available. Down payment can be made via cash, trade-in of existing equipment, or equipment upgrade.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance mobile crane attachments?',
    answer: 'Yes! We can finance mobile crane attachments including grab buckets, magnets, hooks, spreaders, lifting beams, and specialized attachments for construction and infrastructure projects. Attachments can be included in the mobile crane financing package or financed separately as part of the total equipment value. We offer flexible financing for complete mobile crane packages with attachments.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance mobile cranes for bad credit or loan defaults?',
    answer: 'Yes! We consider each application individually and many successful clients have credit issues or previous loan defaults. We look at your current business performance, project contracts, and mobile crane value rather than just credit score. Bad credit or past defaults don\'t mean automatic rejection. The mobile crane itself serves as collateral, reducing our risk and increasing your approval chances. We have excellent approval rates for mobile crane financing even with credit challenges.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I upgrade my mobile crane later?',
    answer: 'Yes! We offer mobile crane trade-in and upgrade programs. After 12-18 months of timely payments, you can trade in your current crane and upgrade to a larger or newer model (e.g., upgrade from 20-ton to 30-ton, or from Hitachi CX200-600 to CX300-7). We refinance the remaining balance and add funds for the new equipment. Many clients start with 20-ton cranes and upgrade to 50-ton models as their business grows.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents do I need for mobile crane financing?',
    answer: 'For individuals: (1) Malaysian IC or Passport copy, (2) 6 months bank statements showing income and transactions, (3) Income proof (salary slips, EPF statements, or project contract copies). For companies: (1) SSM registration certificate (Form 9/24/49), (2) Company bank statements (6 months), (3) Directors\' IC copies for all directors and major shareholders (25%+ ownership), (4) Financial statements if available (audited accounts help but not mandatory), (5) Project contract or quotation if applying for specific project, (6) Mobile crane specification sheet or proforma invoice from supplier. The process is simple and straightforward with minimal paperwork.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you serve all Malaysian states?',
    answer: 'Yes! We serve all Malaysian states including Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Johor, Penang, Perak, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Kelantan, Terengganu, Sabah, and Sarawak. Our office is in Klang, Selangor, but we process applications nationwide through online submission and WhatsApp. Remote area processing available for Sabah, Sarawak, and East Malaysia. Mobile crane delivery available nationwide through our dealer network.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there early repayment penalty?',
    answer: 'No early repayment penalty! You can pay off your mobile crane loan anytime without extra charges. Many clients refinance after 12-18 months when their business grows and they qualify for better rates. You can also make extra payments during peak season to reduce interest costs. This flexibility helps contractors optimize their finances and mobile crane utilization.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the interest rate range?',
    answer: 'Interest rates for mobile crane financing typically range from 7.5% to 12% per annum depending on: (1) Credit profile and credit score, (2) Down payment amount (higher down payment = lower rate), (3) Loan term length (shorter term = lower rate), (4) Equipment age and brand (newer equipment = lower rate, premium brands = lower rate), (5) Your business relationship with ING Heng. Our rates are competitive compared to banks (9-15%) and dealer financing (10-18%). Contact us for personalized quote and see actual rates for your specific situation.'
