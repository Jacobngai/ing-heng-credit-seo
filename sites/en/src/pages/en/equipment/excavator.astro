// FAQs - Comprehensive coverage
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Can I finance used excavators?',
    answer: 'Yes! We finance used excavators 10+ years old from any reputable brand including Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi, Kobelco, Hyundai, and Doosan. The excavator must be in good working condition and pass our inspection. Used excavator financing typically requires 10-20% down payment depending on equipment age and condition.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the maximum excavator age you accept?',
    answer: 'We accept excavators 10+ years old for financing. For excavators 5-7 years old, standard terms apply. For excavators 8-10 years old, we may require higher down payment (15-20%) or shorter loan terms (24-36 months). Equipment even older than 10 years is considered on a case-by-case basis.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance first-time contractors?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! We specialize in helping new contractors get started. Unlike banks that focus only on credit history, we evaluate your project potential, existing contracts, and business plan. We support growing businesses and many successful clients started with us as first-time equipment buyers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I have bad credit or previous loan defaults?',
    answer: 'We consider each application individually. Bad credit or past defaults don\'t mean automatic rejection. We look at your current financial situation, ongoing projects, customer contracts, and equipment value. Many successful clients had credit issues before working with us. The excavator serves as collateral, reducing our risk and increasing your approval chances.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get financing during monsoon season?',
  },
  {
    question: 'What excavator brands do you accept?',
    answer: 'We accept all major brands: Caterpillar (CAT), Komatsu, Hitachi, Kobelco, Hyundai, Doosan, SANY, XCMG, Volvo, Sumitomo, JCB, and Liebherr. Both Japanese, American, Chinese, Korean, and European brands are acceptable. For Chinese brands like SANY and XCMG, we may require slightly higher down payment due to resale value considerations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does the approval process take?',
    answer: 'Standard approval is fast from complete document submission. Urgent cases with immediate project deadlines are processed on urgent cases with premium service. We prioritize contractors who need equipment quickly for government tenders or time-sensitive projects. Submit your application in the morning, get approval by evening.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents do I need to apply?',
    answer: 'For individuals: (1) IC or Passport, (2) 6 months bank statements, (3) Income proof (salary slips, EPF statements, or project contracts). For companies: (1) SSM registration (Form 9/24/49), (2) Company bank statements (6 months), (3) Directors\' IC copies, (4) Financial statements if available (not mandatory for new companies), (5) Project contracts if available (helps approval). The process is simple and straightforward.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I upgrade my excavator later?',
    answer: 'Yes! We offer trade-in and upgrade programs. After 12-18 months of timely payments, you can trade in your current excavator and upgrade to a larger or newer model. We refinance the remaining balance and add funds for the new equipment. Many clients start with 5-ton mini excavators and upgrade to 10-20 ton machines as their business grows.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if the excavator breaks down?',
    answer: 'Equipment insurance is recommended but not mandatory. We can connect you with insurance providers offering comprehensive coverage for excavators. If uninsured equipment breaks down, you remain responsible for loan payments. Consider comprehensive insurance (RM 3,000-8,000 annually depending on value) for peace of mind. Insurance also covers theft, which is common in construction sites.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a penalty for early repayment?',
    answer: 'No early repayment penalty! Pay off your loan anytime without extra charges. Many clients refinance after 12-18 months when their business grows and they qualify for better rates (2-4% lower). You can also make extra payments during peak season to reduce interest costs. This flexibility helps contractors optimize their finances.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is your interest rate?',
    answer: 'Interest rates range from 7.5% to 12% per annum depending on: (1) Credit profile and credit score, (2) Down payment amount (higher down payment = lower rate), (3) Loan term length (shorter term = lower rate), (4) Equipment age and brand (newer equipment = lower rate). Our rates are competitive compared to banks (9-15%) and dealer financing (10-18%). Contact us for personalized quote.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance multiple excavators at once?',
    answer: 'Yes! Fleet financing available for contractors purchasing 2 or more excavators simultaneously. Benefits include: (1) Volume discount on interest rates (0.5-1% reduction), (2) Single consolidated payment, (3) Streamlined approval process. Perfect for contractors expanding operations or taking on multiple large projects simultaneously. We\'ve financed fleets up to 8 excavators for growing businesses.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you require collateral besides the excavator?',
    answer: 'The excavator serves as primary collateral. For loans above RM 500,000, we may require additional collateral such as: (1) Property (residential or commercial), (2) Fixed deposits, (3) Personal or corporate guarantors. Most standard excavator loans (below RM 500,000) need no extra collateral. The equipment value adequately secures the loan.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much can I borrow?',
    answer: 'Minimum loan: RM 30,000 for mini excavators. Maximum loan: RM 3,000,000 for large excavators and fleets. We can finance up to 90% of equipment value (10% down payment required). For used equipment, we may finance 80-85% of current market value (15-20% down payment). Loan amount also depends on your income and repayment capacity.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can foreigners apply for excavator financing?',
    answer: 'Yes, foreigners with valid work permits and Malaysian company registration can apply. Required documents: (1) Valid passport, (2) Work permit or MM2H visa, (3) Malaysian business registration (SSM), (4) Local guarantor (Malaysian citizen or PR), (5) 6 months bank statements. Approval rates for foreigners are slightly lower (85-90%) but still very competitive.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I already have an existing excavator loan?',
    answer: 'We offer refinancing and loan restructuring services. If you\'re paying high interest (above 12%) elsewhere, we can buy out your existing loan and provide better terms. Many clients save 2-4% in interest annually by refinancing with us. We can also consolidate multiple equipment loans into one payment for easier cash flow management.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance excavator attachments and spare parts?',
    answer: 'Yes! We can include attachments (buckets, breakers, hydraulic hammers, rippers, grabs) in the excavator financing package. Spare parts can be financed separately if purchased with the excavator. Package deals available: Excavator + Trailer + Attachments for comprehensive equipment financing. This helps contractors get fully operational equipment in one transaction.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What areas do you serve in Malaysia?',
    answer: 'We serve all Malaysian states: Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Johor, Penang, Perak, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, Sabah, Sarawak, and more. Our office is in Klang, Selangor, but we process applications nationwide. Remote area processing available online and via WhatsApp. We\'ve financed excavators for contractors from Perlis to Sabah.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I try the excavator before committing to financing?',
    answer: 'For used excavators, we strongly encourage inspection and testing before final approval. Bring your experienced operator to test the machine. Check hydraulic systems, engine condition, undercarriage wear, and boom/bucket functionality. We want you to be 100% satisfied with your equipment choice before signing the loan agreement. For new excavators, dealer demonstrations are typically arranged.'
