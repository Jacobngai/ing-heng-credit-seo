// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Why should I own trucks instead of hiring drivers with their own trucks?',
    answer: 'Revenue control. Hiring owner-operator drivers means splitting 60/40. They take 40% because they own the truck. Over time, you pay more than the truck costs. Example: RM 12,000 per trip revenue. You keep RM 7,200, driver takes RM 4,800. That RM 4,800 per trip could pay for your own truck. After 20 trips, you\'ve paid enough to buy a used prime mover. But with driver splits, you keep paying 40% forever. Own your trucks = 100% revenue is yours.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much am I losing by renting prime movers?',
    answer: 'RM 10,000 per month per truck. Forever. That\'s RM 120,000 per year. In 3 years, you pay RM 360,000 in rental fees. For that amount, you could own 2-3 used prime movers. Worse: rental prices increase. Companies raise rates without notice. During peak season, rates jump even higher. Your costs are unpredictable. Owning means fixed monthly payments. After loan is paid off, the truck is yours. Rental fees never stop.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance 10+ year old prime movers?',
    answer: 'Yes. We finance equipment 10+ years old regularly. Banks reject anything over 5 years. We assess actual condition, not just age. Used Volvo FL10: 12 years old, 950,000 km. Banks say finished. We check engine compression, transmission, maintenance records. Properly maintained Volvos run 1.5 million km. That truck has 500,000+ km of productive life left. We approve based on condition and your business needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I have bad credit?',
    answer: 'Bad credit accepted. We evaluate: (1) Equipment value as collateral (2) Your existing trailer business operations (3) Current contracts or regular customers (4) Realistic financing request. Many logistics operators have credit issues from business challenges. We focus on your current business strength, not past credit problems. Active trailer operations + quality truck = approved.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if drivers quit when I hire owner-operators?',
    answer: 'Your operations stop. This is the real risk of depending on driver-owned trucks. Driver gets better offer, takes his truck, you lose capacity. Your trailers sit idle. You scramble to find replacement. During this time, you turn down jobs. Customers go to competitors. When you own the trucks, drivers are replaceable. Truck breaks down, you rent temporary replacement. Driver quits, you hire new driver. Your operations continue. Control means business stability.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I buy used Volvo/Scania or new Chinese brand?',
    answer: 'Used European truck offers better business value. (1) Longevity: Volvo/Scania built for 1 million+ km lifespan. Chinese trucks often need major overhaul at 500k km. (2) Resale value: European trucks retain value. After 5 years, you recover more capital. (3) Reliability: Less downtime means more revenue. Your trailers stay busy. (4) Total cost: Higher initial quality costs less over time than frequent repairs. (5) Driver preference: Better cabins, less fatigue, easier to hire good drivers.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate if owning trucks makes sense?',
    answer: 'Simple math. Current situation: Hiring driver with truck = losing 40% per trip. Or renting = RM 10,000/month fixed cost. Owning: Finance payment might be RM 6,000-8,000/month depending on truck age and price. But you keep 100% revenue. Hire salaried driver (RM 4,000-5,000/month). Total cost similar to rental. Difference: After loan paid off, truck is yours. Revenue becomes pure profit (minus driver salary and maintenance). This is how you build a fleet.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if the truck breaks down?',
    answer: 'This happens to all trucks - owned, rented, or driver-owned. Difference is control. When you own: You choose the workshop. You decide on spare parts quality. You control repair timeline. You maintain relationships with mechanics who prioritize your trucks. When renting: Rental company fixes it, but you still pay rental during downtime. When hiring owner-operators: Driver decides everything. You have no control. Could take weeks. Smart ownership: Buy quality European brand with good parts availability. Build relationship with trusted workshop. Keep basic spares. Downtime is minimized.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I start with one truck and expand?',
    answer: 'Yes. This is the standard growth path. Start: Finance 1 used prime mover. Match with your existing trailer. Hire salaried driver. Keep 100% revenue. Year 1-2: Build payment record. Show consistent operations. Year 2-3: Finance second truck. Now you have 2 prime movers, 2 trailers, 2 drivers. Year 3-5: Third truck. More capacity, more revenue. Better negotiating power with customers. Many successful logistics companies started exactly this way. One owned truck is better than depending on hired trucks forever.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documentation do I need?',
    answer: 'Business documents, not personal only. (1) Company: SSM registration, company bank statements (6 months). (2) Operations proof: Customer contracts, delivery orders, regular clients. (3) Truck details: Seller contact, specifications, registration card, inspection photos. (4) Personal: IC, director\'s personal bank statements. What we DON\'T need: Complex financial projections, certified statements, property ownership proof. We understand logistics business. Your existing trailer operations prove you know the business.'

            <p class="text-xl font-bold text-primary">You own 3 container trailers.</p>

            <p>But you don't own prime movers. You hire owner-operator drivers.</p>

            <p>Every trip: Revenue RM 1,000.</p>

            <p>You split: 60/40.</p>

            <p>You get RM 600. The driver gets RM 400... because HE owns the truck and you don't.</p>

            <p>At the end of the month, you calculate:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>Total revenue: RM 30,000</li>
              <li>Driver's share: RM 12,000</li>
              <li>Your share: RM 18,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When you transfer that RM 12,000 to the driver, does it sting?</p>

            <p>You own the trailers. You found the clients. You manage the operations.</p>

            <p>But RM 12,000 goes to him every month - RM 144,000 per year - just because he owns the truck.</p>

            <p class="text-xl font-bold text-primary">When you see his new car, his renovated house, and you realize YOU paid for it with those 40% splits... does your jaw tighten?</p>

            <p>Or maybe you rent prime movers. RM 10,000 per month.</p>

            <p>When drivers quit, your trailers sit idle. You're scrambling to find trucks. Your clients call someone else.</p>

            <p>That helplessness - when your business success depends on hired drivers or rental companies - does it keep you up at night?</p>

            <p class="text-xl font-bold text-primary">You found a used Volvo FL10. 12 years old. 950,000 km on odometer.</p>

            <p>Banks laugh. "950k km? That truck is finished."</p>

            <p>But you've seen Volvos. They run 1.5 million km with proper maintenance.</p>

            <p><strong>We approve equipment 10+ years old. High mileage considered if maintained.</strong></p>

            <p>Own your trucks. Hire SALARIED drivers.</p>

            <p>100% of transport revenue: Yours to keep.</p>

            <p>Full operational control. No more splits. No more dependencies.</p>

            <p class="text-xl font-bold text-primary border-t-2 border-[#D4A574] pt-4">That's real business ownership.</p>
