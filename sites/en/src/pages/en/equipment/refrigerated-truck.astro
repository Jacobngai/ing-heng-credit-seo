      <div class="faq-grid">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is refrigerated truck financing?</h3>
          <p>
            Refrigerated truck financing is a specialized equipment loan that enables cold chain logistics operators
            to acquire temperature-controlled vehicles for transporting perishable goods. This includes financing
            for the truck chassis, refrigeration unit (Carrier, Thermo King), and temperature monitoring systems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much does it cost to finance a refrigerated truck in Malaysia?</h3>
          <p>
            A 1-ton refrigerated truck costs RM 120,000-180,000, 3-ton trucks cost RM 200,000-280,000, and 5-ton
            trucks cost RM 300,000-450,000. With 20% down payment, monthly installments range from RM 2,000-7,500
            depending on loan term (5-7 years) and your credit profile.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What temperature range do refrigerated trucks maintain?</h3>
          <p>
            Standard refrigerated trucks maintain temperatures from -25°C (frozen foods) to +5°C (fresh produce).
            Multi-temperature units can maintain different zones: frozen (-18°C), chilled (0-5°C), and ambient
            (15-20°C) in the same vehicle.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long does refrigerated truck financing approval take?</h3>
          <p>
            Pre-approval within 2-3 days, full approval within 5-7 working days. Faster than traditional banks
            (3-4 weeks). We understand cold chain business urgency, especially during peak seasons like CNY, Ramadan,
            and year-end.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I finance a used refrigerated truck?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, we finance used refrigerated trucks 10+ years old. Vehicle must pass mechanical inspection
            and refrigeration unit performance test. Used truck financing requires 25-30% down payment vs. 15-20%
            for new units.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What documents are required for refrigerated truck financing?</h3>
          <p>
            Required: IC/passport, 3-6 months bank statements, EPF statements, business registration (if company),
            existing vehicle registration (if any), supplier quotation. For pharmaceutical logistics: GDP certification
            or application proof.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is HACCP certification required for refrigerated truck financing?</h3>
          <p>
            HACCP certification is not mandatory for financing approval, but it increases approval chances and
            secures better rates. HACCP-certified operators qualify for premium contracts (supermarkets, pharmaceuticals)
            which strengthens repayment capability.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is the ROI on refrigerated truck investment?</h3>
          <p>
            With supermarket contracts: 18 months payback. Fresh produce distribution: 24-30 months. Pharmaceutical
            cold chain: 15-20 months (premium rates). Average daily revenue: RM 400-800 per truck. Peak seasons
            (CNY, Ramadan) can double monthly income.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can self-employed fresh produce traders get refrigerated truck financing?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, we specialize in self-employed and SME financing. Requirements: 2+ years in fresh produce business,
            consistent income proof (bank statements), existing customer contracts (preferred but not mandatory),
            industry references from Selayang/Klang markets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What refrigeration brands can I finance?</h3>
          <p>
            We finance all major brands: Carrier Transicold, Thermo King, Zanotti, Dongin, and Hubbard. Truck chassis:
            Isuzu, Hino, Fuso, Mercedes, Toyota. We provide brand comparison advice based on your cargo type and routes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do you finance GPS and temperature monitoring systems?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, we finance complete cold chain solutions including GPS tracking (RM 800-1,500), temperature data
            loggers (RM 500-2,000), and installation costs. These systems are essential for HACCP compliance and
            premium contracts.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is the typical loan term for refrigerated truck financing?</h3>
          <p>
            Standard terms: 5-7 years for new trucks, 3-5 years for used trucks. Longer terms (up to 7 years) reduce
            monthly installments but increase total interest. We recommend matching loan term to your contract length
            for optimal cash flow.
