## The Logistics Reality: Speed Wins Contracts



      

Your logistics company just won a major contract. You need additional lorries immediately to fulfill the delivery obligations. Every day of delay means missed deadlines, penalties, and lost revenue.



      

Traditional bank financing takes 2-4 weeks. Your contract starts in 5 days. You can't wait.



      

This is the daily reality for Malaysian logistics companies. The difference between winning and losing contracts often comes down to equipment availability—and financing speed determines availability.



      

## Why Traditional Financing Fails Logistics



      

### The Bank Timeline Problem



      

**Typical Bank Financing Process:**
      
• Application submission: Day 1
      
• Document verification: Days 2-5
      
• Credit assessment: Days 6-10
      
• Committee approval: Days 11-14
      
• Agreement signing: Days 15-18
      
• Disbursement: Days 19-21



      

**Logistics Contract Reality:**
      
• Contract award notification: Day 1
      
• Mobilization deadline: Day 5-7
      
• First delivery deadline: Day 10



      

**Result:** Bank financing timeline doesn't match logistics contract urgency. Either you lose the contract, or you decline growth opportunities.



      

### Why Banks Are Slow



      

**1. Generic Underwriting:** Banks treat logistics companies like retail businesses. They don't understand:
      
• Contract-based revenue (long-term contracts predict cash flow)
      
• Seasonal patterns (peak seasons like Hari Raya, year-end)
      
• Fleet operations (multiple vehicles = diversified revenue)
      
• Asset collateral (lorries maintain value, are easily resold)



      

**2. Committee Decisions:** Most loan officers can't approve. They submit to committees that meet weekly. If you miss the meeting, wait another week.



      

**3. Excessive Documentation:** Banks require:
      
• 6-12 months bank statements
      
• Audited financial statements
      
• Business plans with projections
      
• Tax returns for 2-3 years
      
• Directors' guarantees



      

**For Logistics Companies:** You're busy operating lorries and serving clients. You don't have time to gather paperwork for weeks.



      

## Fast-Track Approval: What You Need



      

### Essential Documents (Have Ready)



      

- **Business Registration:** SSM certificate (confirm company exists and active)
- **Director's IC:** Front and back copy (identify company decision-makers)
- **3-6 Months Bank Statements:** Show revenue flow, customer payments, operational expenses
        **Lorry Quotation:** From dealer or seller (specifies make, model, year, price)
        **JPJ Road Tax & Insurance:** For existing lorries (show compliance history)
- **Contract Award Letter:** If financing for specific contract (demonstrates revenue source)



      

### Optional Documents (Speed Up Approval)



      

- **Existing Fleet List:** All lorries owned, ages, conditions (shows asset base)
      **Client Contracts:** Signed agreements showing recurring revenue (predicts cash flow)
      **CIDB/PKPK Certificates:** For construction logistics (shows qualifications)
      **APAD Permits:** For freight lorries (shows compliance)



      

### What NOT to Include



      

Don't overwhelm with unnecessary documents:
      
• Old bank statements (last 6 months sufficient)
      
• Irrelevant business plans (we focus on current operations)
      
• Personal tax returns (unless sole proprietor without separate business accounts)
      
• Complex financial projections (current contracts speak louder)



      

## Approval Factors: What Financiers Assess



      

### Positive Indicators (Approvals Faster)



      

- **Active Contracts:** Signed agreements with reputable clients (government, large corporations) demonstrate guaranteed revenue
- **Existing Fleet:** Already own lorries successfully operating (proves logistics capability)
        **Consistent Revenue:** Regular bank deposits from multiple clients (diversified income)
        **Experience:** 2+ years in logistics business (industry knowledge reduces risk)
        **Asset Knowledge:** Understanding of lorry maintenance, resale values (responsible asset management)



      

### Yellow Flags (Not Deal-Breakers, But Explain)



      

- **Seasonal Revenue:** Logistics often seasonal ( Hari Raya slowdowns, year-end peaks)—explain this pattern
      **Overdraft Usage:** Common due to payment delays (Net-60 terms from clients)—highlight receivables
      **New Contracts:** Recent contract wins may show temporary low cash—provide award letters
      **Multiple Financiers:** Existing lorry loans—show payment history and fleet utilization
      **Previous Rejections:** Banks often reject logistics for "high risk"—we understand the industry better



      

## Fast Approval Strategies: Pro Tips



      

### Strategy 1: Complete Documentation First



      

**Don't Submit Partial Applications:**
      
• Gather ALL documents before applying
      
• Incomplete applications trigger "come back later" responses
      
• Each follow-up delays process by days
      
**Result:** Complete applications processed 24-48 hours; incomplete applications take weeks



      

### Strategy 2: Finance Specific Lorries



      

**Avoid Generic "Lorry Financing" Requests:**
      
• Specify exact make, model, year, price
      
• Provide dealer quotation
      
• Explain business purpose (e.g., "for new contract with Factory XYZ delivering 500 tons monthly")
      
**Result:** Specific requests processed faster than vague "need working capital" applications



      

### Strategy 3: Highlight Contract Revenue



      

**Show Where Repayment Comes From:**
      
• Contract award letters with payment terms
      
• Client contracts showing monthly/quarterly payments
      
• Delivery schedules confirming ongoing work
      
**Result:** Contract revenue = guaranteed repayment = fast approval



      

### Strategy 4: Leverage Existing Assets



      

**Use Your Fleet as Strength:**
      
• List all owned lorries (make, model, year, current value)
      >• Show insurance and road tax (compliance)
      
• Demonstrate successful fleet management
      
**Result:** Existing assets prove capability and reduce lender risk



      

### Strategy 5: Choose Right Financier



      

**Banks vs. Specialized Lenders:**
      
• Banks: Lower rates but slower (3-4 weeks), strict requirements
      
• Specialized lenders (Ing Heng Credit): Fast (24-48 hours), understand logistics, flexible terms
      
**Result:** Specialized lenders often approve when banks reject, with speed that meets logistics timeline needs



      

## Ing Heng Credit: Logistics Specialists



      

### 1. We Understand Logistics Cash Flow



      

We know that:
      
• Clients pay Net-30, Net-60, even Net-90 (delays inevitable)
      
• Revenue fluctuates seasonally (peak seasons vs. slow months)
      
• Large contracts have milestone payments (not monthly cash flow)
      
• Fuel costs consume 30-40% of revenue (volatile)



      

**Our Response:**
      
• Seasonal payment structures (lower payments during slow months, higher during peak)
      
• Progress payment alignment (match installments to contract milestones)
      
• Payment holidays during cash crunch periods
      
• Skip payments when client delays occur (with notice)



      

### 2. 0% Down Payment Preserves Working Capital



      

Logistics operations require cash flow:
      
• Driver salaries (weekly)
      
• Fuel advances (daily)
      
• Toll payments (every trip)
      
• Maintenance (ongoing)



      

**0% Down Payment Benefit:**
      
• Preserve RM40,000-RM80,000 capital (for RM200,000-RM400,000 lorry)
      
• Available for operations while awaiting first client payment
      
• Prevents cash crunch in first 2-3 months



      

### 3. Fast Approval = Contract Wins



      

Logistics contracts often awarded with short mobilization windows:



      

**Our Timeline:**
      
• Apply: Day 1 (anytime)
      
• Decision: Day 2 (within 24 hours of complete docs)
      
• Agreement & Disbursement: Day 3 (48 hours total)
      
• Lorry Acquisition: Day 4-5



      

**Result:** Deploy lorries before most competitors complete bank applications.



      

### 4. Finance Entire Fleets



      

Multiple lorry financing available:
      
• Bundle 2, 5, or 10 lorries in single agreement
      
• Streamlined documentation (one set for entire fleet)
      
• Discounted rates for fleet financing
      
• Flexible structures (mix of new and used lorries)



      

## Real-World Fast Approval Stories



      

### Port Klang Container Haulage



      

\"Won contract requiring 5 container lorries immediately. Bank said 'apply, we'll process in 3-4 weeks.' Contract started in 7 days. Couldn't deliver. Applied to Ing Heng Credit Friday, approved Saturday. Purchased 5 lorries Sunday. Delivered Monday. Contract saved, client impressed, won additional contracts due to reliability. 0% down payment preserved RM100,000 used for driver salaries and fuel while waiting for first payment (Net-60 terms). Fast approval didn't just save time—it won the contract.\"\n*— Ahmad Zaki, Logistics Manager*



      

### Cold Chain Logistics Expansion



      

\"Frozen food expansion required 3 refrigerated lorries. Clients increasing orders but our reefers at capacity. Needed reefers in 10 days. Traditional financing would take 3 weeks. Ing Heng approved in 48 hours with 0% down. Purchased 3 used reefers (40% cheaper than new, still 5 years remaining useful life). Deployed immediately, secured new clients. Monthly revenue increased RM60,000. 0% down payment preserved RM60,000 used for warehouse expansion (needed for additional storage). Fast financing enabled growth that paid for itself in 4 months.\"\n*— Sarah Lim, Operations Director*



      

## Fleet Financing: Multiple Lorries Strategy



      

### Financing 2-5 Lorries Simultaneously



      

**Streamlined Documentation:**
      
• One application covers entire fleet
      
• Single credit assessment for all lorries
      
• Unified agreement (multiple asset schedules)



      

**Flexible Options:**
      
• Mix new and used lorries (optimize cost vs. warranty)
      
• Different configurations (tonnage, body types) in single agreement
      
• Staggered delivery dates (match cash flow with deployment)



      

**Cost Efficiency:**
      
• Fleet discounts: 0.5-1% lower interest per additional lorry
      
• Documentation savings: One set of paperwork vs. multiple
      
• Faster approval: Single assessment vs. multiple applications



      

## Common Approval Mistakes to Avoid



      

### Mistake 1: Incomplete Documentation



      

Submitting application with missing bank statements:
      
• Application sits pending awaiting documents
      
• Follow-ups delay process
      
• Competitors with complete docs approved first
      
**Solution:** Gather ALL documents before applying



      

### Mistake 2: Vague Business Purpose



      

Stating "need working capital" without specifics:
      
• Raises risk concerns
      
• Requires additional explanation
      
• Delays decision
      
**Solution:** Specify exact lorry, contract, or expansion purpose



      

### Mistake 3: Hiding Credit Issues



      

Not mentioning previous loan rejections or payment issues:
      
• Financier discovers during background check
      
• Appears dishonest (raises red flags)
      
• Application rejected or delayed
      
**Solution:** Explain issues upfront, provide context and resolution



      

### Mistake 4: Unrealistic Budget



      

Applying for lorry financing beyond repayment capacity:
      
• Installments exceed realistic monthly cash flow
      
• Application rejected or approved with reduced amount
      
• Wasted time and credit inquiries
      
**Solution:** Calculate realistic budget based on contract revenue before applying



      

## Pre-Approval: Get Ready Before You Need



      

### Benefits of Pre-Approval



      

- **Know Your Budget:** Get approved amount before shopping (know exact price range)
- **Negotiate from Strength:** Pre-approval = cash buyer in dealer negotiations
- **Move Fast on Opportunities:** When contract awarded, financing already secured
- **Identify Issues Early:** Resolve documentation or credit issues before urgent need



      

### How Pre-Approval Works



      

**Step 1:** Submit basic documents (SSM, IC, bank statements)
      
**Step 2:** Receive pre-approval letter with amount
      
**Step 3:** Shop for lorries knowing your budget
      
**Step 4:** Final approval once specific lorry chosen (48 hours)



      

## The Bottom Line: Speed = Revenue



      

In logistics, time is literally money. Every day without additional lorries is lost revenue:



      



      

Fast approval financing isn't just convenient—it's competitive necessity. The 2-3 week bank process costs RM30,000-RM100,000 in lost revenue. 48-hour approval preserves that revenue and secures contracts.



      

0% down payment financing preserves working capital for operations. Fleet financing enables scalable growth. Flexible payment structures match logistics cash flow reality.
