  #  Logistics Business Loan Malaysia: Truck and Transport Equipment Financing 

  Get logistics business loan Malaysia with 0% deposit. Finance trucks, trailers, forklifts for your logistics company. Fast approval, flexible payment terms. 

     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     # Logistics Business Loan Malaysia: Truck and Transport Equipment Financing

When you’re splitting transport revenue 60/40 with a hired driver because you don’t own the truck, does that RM 12,000 monthly payment to someone else’s pocket make your stomach drop? Every container haul, every delivery run, you’re building someone else’s logistics empire while your business stays dependent.

Logistics operators across Malaysia face a paralyzing problem: banks reject truck financing for transport companies, especially for the proven, reliable vehicles that actually generate profits. Meanwhile, revenue-sharing with truck owners eats 40-60% of potential income.

**The breakthrough solution?** Logistics business loans designed specifically for equipment ownership with **0% deposit financing** and **100% loan amounts** - even for trucks and equipment banks won’t consider.

## Why Logistics Companies Need Equipment Business Loans

The logistics industry runs on razor-thin margins and instant availability. When you don’t own your transport assets, you’re always one phone call away from business disruption. Here’s why equipment ownership through business loans beats dependency every time:

### The Revenue-Sharing Trap That Destroys Profits

**Container Trailer Revenue-Sharing Reality:**

• Trip revenue: RM 800 per container

• Driver/truck owner share: 60% = RM 480

• Your share: 40% = RM 320

• **Monthly loss to truck owner: RM 15,000-20,000**

**Ownership Through Business Loan:**

• Same trip revenue: RM 800

• Your share: 95% = RM 760 (minus fuel/maintenance)

• Driver salary: RM 3,500-4,500

• **Monthly profit increase: RM 12,000-15,000**

When Logistics Operator Lee calculated his container transport revenue over 2 years - RM 480,000 paid to truck owners - he realized he could have purchased THREE prime movers for that amount. Banks rejected his loan application because his target Volvo prime mover was 11 years old. We approved it and he tripled his margins overnight.

### Transport Equipment Banks Won’t Finance

Traditional banks have restrictive policies that kill logistics financing opportunities:

**Bank Rejection Criteria:**

• Vehicle age limit: Maximum 5-7 years

• High deposit requirement: 25-35% down payment

• Perfect credit scores required

• Extensive documentation demands

• Lengthy approval process: 8-16 weeks

**Our Logistics Loan Approach:**

• Vehicle age: 10+ years accepted

• **Deposit requirement: 0% down payment**

• Practical credit assessment

• Industry-focused documentation

• **Fast approval process**

## Types of Logistics Equipment We Finance

## Logistics Business Loan Benefits: 0% Deposit Financing

**Our 0% Deposit Logistics Loans:**

When Logistics Manager William needed a container trailer for port operations, banks demanded RM 80,000 down payment he couldn’t spare. Our 0% deposit financing meant he could start hauling containers immediately and use revenue to pay monthly installments.

## Transport Equipment Maintenance and Value

### Why Older Logistics Vehicles Make Sense

**Industry Reality:**

• Well-maintained trucks operate 15-20 years

• Commercial vehicles built for durability

• Regular maintenance preserves function

• **Age doesn’t mean unreliability**

**Financial Logic:**

• Older vehicles: Lower monthly payments

• Proven performance track record

• Parts availability and service support

• **Better ROI for logistics operators**

### Condition-Based Value Assessment

**Our Evaluation Process:**

• Engine condition and mileage

• Transmission and drivetrain check

• Body and structural integrity

• Maintenance history verification

• **Condition matters more than age**

When Transport Manager Rahman found a 13-year-old Mercedes Actros with complete service records and only 800,000km, banks wouldn’t consider it. We financed RM 380,000 based on the truck’s excellent condition. Two years later, it’s still his top-performing prime mover for Singapore routes.
