Why Buy Second-Hand?
          

          


            For warehouse operators in Shah Alam and Klang Valley, buying a second-hand forklift makes financial sense. A well-maintained used unit costs **40-60% less than new**, and with proper financing, monthly payments can be lower than rental rates.
          



          
            
              Ownership vs Rental: Real Savings

                **Build equity** - Every payment owns the equipment, not landlord's pocket
- 
                  
                
                **Asset ownership** - Sell anytime or trade-in for upgrade
- 
                  
                
                **Tax depreciation** - Claim capital allowance on owned equipment
- 
                  
                
                **No availability worries** - Your equipment, always ready


          

          
            Complete Inspection Checklist
          

          
            Use this checklist before committing to any second-hand forklift. Skip these steps, and you could face RM 10,000-20,000 in repair bills within the first year.
          



          

### 1. Hour Meter & Age Check


          

- **Under 8,000 hours** = Low mileage, good condition expected
- **8,000-12,000 hours** = Moderate use, inspect carefully
- **Over 12,000 hours** = High usage, expect major repairs soon
- **Verify year of manufacture** - Check serial number with manufacturer
- **Match hour meter to condition** - Signs of tampering? Walk away.



          

### 2. Mast & Lift System


          

- **Extend mast fully** - Check for smooth operation, no jerking
- **Inspect lift chains** - No cracks, proper tension, lubricated
- **Check cylinders** - No leaks around hydraulic seals
- **Test tilt function** - Both forward and backward smooth
- **Look for side shift** - Additional wear points to inspect



          

### 3. Hydraulic System


          

- **Check for leaks** - Around hoses, cylinders, pump, control valves
- **Inspect hydraulic oil** - Should be clear, not burnt smell or dark color
- **Test lift strength** - Rated capacity should lift without struggle
- **Listen to pump** - No whining or unusual noises when operating
- **Check control levers** - Smooth operation, not sticky or loose



          

### 4. Tires & Wheels


          

- **Cushion tires** - Check for cracks, flat spots, uneven wear
- **Pneumatic tires** - Check tread depth, sidewall damage, proper inflation
- **Wheel bearings** - No play, rotate smoothly without noise
- **Tighten wheel nuts** - Should be properly torqued
- **Check for wheel misalignment** - Uneven tire wear indicates problem



          

### 5. Battery & Electric System (for Electric Forklifts)


          

- **Battery age** - Lead-acid over 3 years? Budget for replacement
- **Battery capacity test** - Should hold charge through full shift
- **Check for corrosion** - Around terminals and cables
- **Charger condition** - Compatible with battery? Working properly?
- **Consider lithium-ion upgrade** - Add cost to financing if replacing



          

### 6. Engine & Transmission (for Diesel/LPG Forklifts)


          

- **Start cold** - Should start easily, not excessive cranking
- **Check exhaust smoke** - Black smoke (fuel issue), blue smoke (burning oil)
- **Listen to engine** - No knocking, ticking, or unusual noises
- **Test transmission** - Smooth shifting in all gears, no slipping
- **Check fluid levels** - Engine oil, transmission fluid, coolant



          

### 7. Brakes & Steering


          

- **Test brake performance** - Should stop firmly, no pulling to one side
- **Check brake pads/shoes** - Inspect thickness, even wear
- **Test parking brake** - Should hold on incline
- **Check steering** - No play in wheel, turns smoothly both directions
- **Test power steering** - Should operate effortlessly, not whining



          

### 8. Safety Features & DOSH Compliance


          
            

#### CRITICAL: DOSH Certificate Required


            


              **Do NOT buy any forklift without a valid Certificate of Fitness for Lifting Machinery from DOSH.** This is required by law and mandatory for financing approval.
            


            

- - Request certificate before payment
- - Verify certificate matches machine serial number
- - Check certificate expiry date
- - Certificate must be current and valid (not expired)


          

          

- **Seat belt** - Functional, not frayed or damaged
- **Overhead guard** - No damage, securely attached
- **Horn** - Working properly, loud enough
- **Backup alarm** - Operational (if equipped)
- **Lights** - Headlights, taillights, warning lights working
- **Fork positioner** - Properly adjusted, not loose
