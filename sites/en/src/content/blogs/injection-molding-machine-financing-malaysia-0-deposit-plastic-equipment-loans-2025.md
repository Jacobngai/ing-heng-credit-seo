  #  Injection Molding Machine Financing Malaysia: 0% Deposit Plastic Equipment Loans 2025 

  Get injection molding machine financing in Malaysia with 0% deposit and 100% financing. Fast approval for new and used plastic manufacturing equipment up to 15 years old. 

     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     # Injection Molding Machine Financing Malaysia: Get Your Plastic Manufacturing Equipment with 0% Deposit

When you watch that RM 22,000 rental check leave your account every month for the injection molding machine you don’t own, does your chest constrict thinking: “I just paid for another month of building someone else’s plastic manufacturing empire while my own production orders sit waiting?”

When the equipment rental company calls at 3:30 PM saying “we need the machine back tomorrow for scheduled maintenance,” and you have a critical production run of 50,000 plastic components due for your biggest client by Friday, do you feel that dread settle in your stomach knowing you’ll miss the delivery deadline and lose the contract?

When you calculate your monthly plastic production costs and realize RM 25,000 goes to equipment rental—money that could be building your manufacturing assets if you owned the injection molding machine—does that frustration burn in your throat?

**Stop financing other people’s plastic manufacturing empires. Start building your own injection molding business.**

## Your Machine. Your Production Cycles. Your Plastic Manufacturing Profits.

At Ing Heng Credit, we understand the plastic manufacturing trap that keeps producers stuck in rental cycles. That’s why we offer **0% deposit injection molding machine financing** with **100% financing options** that let you own your equipment from day one.

No more rental schedules disrupting your production planning.
No more monthly payments disappearing into rental companies.
No more lost orders because molding equipment isn’t available when you need it.

**Your injection molding machine. Your production timeline. Your plastic manufacturing profits.**

## The Plastic Manufacturing Rental Trap Costing You Thousands

### The Hidden Cost of Renting Injection Molding Equipment

Lim, a plastic component manufacturer from Johor, was paying RM 25,000 monthly to rent a 180-ton injection molding machine. After 18 months, he’d paid RM 450,000 in rental fees.

**For that same amount, he could have owned the injection molding machine outright.**

But the rental company made it seem reasonable: “No maintenance worries, no operator training costs, just pay monthly and focus on plastic production.”

What they didn’t tell him:

• He built zero equity despite paying RM 450,000

• Every client order profit was reduced by RM 25,000 monthly overhead

• His business couldn’t scale because he didn’t own production assets

• When he needed extended machine time for large molding runs, it wasn’t guaranteed

• Critical production schedules were hostage to rental company maintenance timelines

### The Production Schedule Control Problem

**Rental companies prioritize their equipment utilization revenue, not your delivery commitments.**

• Need extra machine time for a rush plastic order? “Sorry, next customer is scheduled.”

• Want to run overnight production cycles? “Machine must be returned by 6 PM.”

• Equipment needs maintenance during your production run? “Technician comes next week.”

**When you don’t own the injection molding machine, you don’t control your plastic manufacturing destiny.**

### The Plastic Manufacturing Growth Limitation

Here’s what injection molding rental companies won’t tell you: **You can’t build a serious plastic manufacturing business on rented machines.**

OEMs and large plastic buyers evaluate your production capacity when awarding contracts. If you own RM 600,000 in injection molding equipment, you can bid on RM 2 million annual plastic component contracts.

If you own nothing but pay RM 25,000 monthly in rental? You’re stuck taking small batch plastic jobs forever.

**Plastic manufacturing clients want partners with permanent production capability, not rental dependency.**

## 0% Deposit: Your Path to Plastic Manufacturing Asset Ownership

### What 0% Deposit Really Means for Injection Molding Machines

**Zero upfront payment. Finance 100% of the plastic manufacturing equipment value.**

• Injection molding machine costs RM 350,000? Finance RM 350,000.

• Need RM 600,000 for a premium multi-cavity machine? Finance the full amount.

• Want to preserve your cash for plastic resin inventory and mold tooling? Finance everything.

**This is your major advantage over competitors still trapped in rental cycles.**

### Why We Offer 0% Deposit When Others Don’t

**Traditional banks require 30-40% deposit for injection molding equipment because:**

• They don’t understand plastic manufacturing cash flow cycles

• They fear rapid technology depreciation in plastic production

• They use outdated lending criteria for specialized manufacturing equipment

**We offer 0% deposit because:**

• We understand plastic manufacturing working capital reality

• We know quality injection molding machines hold value for decades

• We assess production potential and market demand, not just financial statements

• We’ve seen 15-year-old injection molding machines still producing quality plastic parts profitably

**40+ years financing plastic manufacturing equipment taught us: The machine pays for itself when the manufacturer owns it.**

### Real Customer Example: Sarah’s Plastic Manufacturing Success Story

Sarah needed a used Chen Hsong 150-ton injection molding machine (9 years old) for her automotive plastic component business.

**Bank Response:** “Rejected. Equipment too old for manufacturing loan. Minimum 40% deposit required for plastic production equipment.”

**Our Response:** “Approved. 0% deposit. 100% financing.”

**Results after 15 months:**

• Monthly payment: RM 9,800 (vs RM 25,000 rental)

• Savings: RM 15,200 monthly

• Additional contracts: 3 new automotive plastic suppliers (asset-backed bidding)

• Production growth: From RM 140,000 to RM 380,000 monthly revenue

• Quality improvement: Consistent plastic part quality with owned equipment

**Sarah built plastic manufacturing equity while others built rental company profits.**

## We Finance Plastic Manufacturing Equipment Banks Reject

### 10+ Year Injection Molding Machines: Our Plastic Manufacturing Specialty

**Banks say:** “Sorry, injection molding equipment must be under 5 years old for technology relevance.”

**We say:** “Show us a well-maintained 15-year-old Arburg machine and we’ll finance it.”

**Why age doesn’t matter to us for plastic manufacturing equipment:**

• Quality injection molding machines run millions of cycles over 15-20 years

• Proper maintenance and servicing matter more than manufacturing date

• Experienced plastic manufacturers know machine condition better than banks

• Some of our most successful clients operate 15-20 year old injection molding equipment profitably

• Plastic part quality depends on maintenance and mold quality, not machine age

### Customer Success: Emergency Production Capability Recovery

**Situation:** Rahman’s main 220-ton injection molding machine suffered hydraulic system failure during a critical automotive plastic component contract.

Repair would cost RM 95,000 and take 8 weeks. Contract delivery was due in 6 weeks with RM 180,000 penalty clause.

**Bank Timeline:** 4-5 weeks for specialized plastic manufacturing equipment loan approval
**Our Timeline:** 48 hours from application to financing approval

**Outcome:** Rahman got a replacement injection molding machine in 5 days, completed the plastic component contract on schedule, and earned RM 110,000 profit instead of paying RM 180,000 in contract penalties.

**When plastic manufacturing deadlines knock, we answer immediately.**
