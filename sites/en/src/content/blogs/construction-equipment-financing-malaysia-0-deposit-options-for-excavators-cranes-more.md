Equipment Financing  December 20, 2025      8 min read
  #  Construction Equipment Financing Malaysia: 0% Deposit Options for Excavators, Cranes &amp; More 

  Get construction equipment financing in Malaysia with 0% deposit required. We finance excavators, cranes, bulldozers, trucks - even 10+ year old equipment. Fast approval for contractors. 

     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     # Construction Equipment Financing Malaysia: 0% Deposit Solutions for Every Contractor

When Ahmad’s rental company called at 5 PM demanding their excavator back the next morning, and he had three days of foundation work scheduled, do you remember that sinking feeling in your stomach knowing you’d lose the RM45,000 contract?

When you write that RM18,000 monthly rental check for equipment you’ll never own, and you walk past the 12-year-old CAT 320D in the yard that you DON’T control, does your chest tighten knowing you’re building someone else’s wealth instead of your own?

You’re not alone. Every month, Malaysian contractors hand over hundreds of thousands in rental fees, watching profitable projects slip away because equipment isn’t available when needed.

**But what if you could own your construction equipment with 0% deposit and start building equity from day one?**

## What is Construction Equipment Financing?

Construction equipment financing is a funding solution that lets you acquire excavators, cranes, bulldozers, and other construction machinery by paying over time instead of full cash upfront.

**How it works:**

• Choose your construction equipment (new or used, even 10+ years old)

• Apply with our 0% deposit option

• Get fast approval within 1-3 business days

• Own the equipment immediately with monthly payments

• Build equity with every payment instead of enriching rental companies

**The Ing Heng Advantage:**

• **0% deposit required** - Finance up to 100% of equipment value

• **Accept equipment 10+ years old** - Even 15-year equipment considered if productive

• **Fast approval process** - Days, not weeks like banks

• **High success rate** - Including contractors with credit challenges

## Why Construction Contractors Choose Equipment Financing Over Rental

### The Hidden Cost of Equipment Rental

**Ahmad’s Reality Check:**
Ahmad rented a CAT 320D excavator for 18 months at RM16,000 monthly. Total paid: RM288,000.

**What RM288,000 could have bought:**

• A well-maintained 2010 CAT 320D excavator worth RM280,000

• **OWNED, not rented**

• **Available 24/7, not subject to rental company schedules**

• **Builds equity, not rental company profits**

### Your Equipment. Your Schedule. Your Revenue.

**Instead of:**

> 
“Sorry boss, rental company needs the loader back. We’ll have to pause the project and pay standby costs.”

**You get:**

> 
“Our excavator is ready. We’ll finish this project today and move to the next site tomorrow. Full control, full productivity.”

**Benefits of ownership:**

• **Schedule freedom** - Equipment available when YOU need it

• **Revenue maximization** - Keep 100% of project profits

• **Asset building** - Own RM500,000+ worth of productive equipment

• **Business growth** - Bid on multiple projects simultaneously

• **Emergency response** - Available for high-paying weekend work

## Success Stories: Contractors Who Chose Ownership

### Case Study 1: From Rental Victim to Fleet Owner

**Before:**
Rashid, a Klang contractor, rented excavators for RM16,000 monthly. When government tender required simultaneous work at three sites, rental companies couldn’t provide three units. He lost a RM850,000 contract.

**After financing with Ing Heng:**

• Financed three used excavators: 2009 CAT 320D, 2011 Komatsu PC200, 2010 Hitachi ZX200

• Total equipment value: RM680,000

• 0% deposit, RM14,800 total monthly payments

• **Saved RM1,200/month compared to renting one unit**

• **Can now bid on multiple projects simultaneously**

• **Won the government tender he couldn’t take before**

**Rashid’s words:**

> 
“Banks said equipment too old. Ing Heng said ‘if it works, we finance it.’ These machines generate RM45,000+ monthly. The rental savings alone pay the financing.”

### Case Study 2: Emergency Equipment, Emergency Revenue

**Situation:**
Lim’s company got a call Saturday evening - major pipe burst at industrial complex, needed immediate excavation to prevent flooding. Project value: RM28,000 for weekend work.

**With rental equipment:**

• Rental company closed weekends

• Lost the emergency project

• **Revenue lost: RM28,000**

**With owned equipment:**

• Mobilized immediately

• Completed repair by Sunday noon

• Client paid premium for emergency response

• **Weekend revenue: RM35,000**

**Lim’s insight:**

> 
“Emergency work pays double rates. But only if you control your equipment. That one weekend job covered three months of financing payments.”

### Case Study 3: The 15-Year Equipment Success

**Banks said:** “Equipment too old, maximum 5 years only.”

**Ing Heng said:** “Show us the service records.”

**Equipment:** 2008 CAT 966H wheel loader (15 years old)
**Purchase price:** RM285,000
**Condition:** 14,500 hours, well-maintained by previous quarry owner
**Financing:** 0% deposit, 48 months, RM7,850 monthly

**Three years later:**

• Still operating 10+ hours daily at quarry

• Generated over RM2.1 million revenue

• Maintenance costs: RM45,000 total (well within budget)

• Current value: RM195,000 (excellent resale retention)

**Owner’s testimonial:**

> 
“Banks think age equals problems. Reality: maintenance equals longevity. This 15-year loader generates RM25,000+ monthly profit. Age is just a number.”

## Why Banks Reject Construction Equipment (And Why We Don’t)

### Bank Limitations vs Ing Heng Flexibility

**Traditional Banks Say NO to:**

• ❌ Equipment over 5-7 years old

• ❌ Contractors with credit challenges

• ❌ Small companies under 3 years

• ❌ Equipment from China (XCMG, Sany, Shantui)

• ❌ 0% deposit requests

• ❌ Self-employed contractors

• ❌ Companies without audited accounts

**Ing Heng Says YES to:**

• ✅ Equipment 10+ years old (if productive)

• ✅ Contractors rebuilding credit

• ✅ New companies with good business plans

• ✅ Quality Chinese brands (Sany, XCMG proven reliable)

• ✅ 0% deposit for qualified applicants

• ✅ Sole proprietors and partnerships

• ✅ Companies with management accounts

### Our Equipment Age Assessment Process

**We don’t just look at age - we evaluate:**

• **Service history** - Regular maintenance records

• **Operating hours** - Hours vs age (8,000 hours over 10 years = excellent)

• **Previous ownership** - Quarry vs rental vs government (affects wear patterns)

• **Brand reputation** - CAT, Komatsu, Hitachi retain value longer

• **Current condition** - Physical inspection by our assessors

• **Parts availability** - Can it be maintained economically?

**Example of good 12-year equipment:**

• 2012 CAT 320D excavator

• 9,500 operating hours (excellent for age)

• Single owner (not rental fleet)

• Complete service records

• Recent major service completed

• **Verdict: Approved for financing**

**Example of problematic 5-year equipment:**

• 2019 generic brand excavator

• 18,000 operating hours (excessive for age)

• Multiple previous owners

• Incomplete service history

• Visible wear and delayed maintenance

• **Verdict: Declined (despite young age)**
