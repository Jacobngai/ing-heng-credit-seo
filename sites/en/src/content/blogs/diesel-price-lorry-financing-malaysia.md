Diesel Subsidy Rationalization: What Changed?
          

          


            On June 10, 2024, the Malaysian government implemented diesel subsidy restructuring in Peninsular Malaysia. The price increased from **RM2.15 to RM3.35 per liter** - a 55% jump that immediately impacted logistics operators' operating costs.
          



          


            The first week after rationalization showed a **30% reduction in total diesel sold**, demonstrating the policy's effectiveness in curbing smuggling and unauthorized use. However, legitimate logistics businesses faced higher operating expenses.
