Mandatory GPS Requirements for Prime Movers
          

          


            The Malaysian government mandates GPS tracking for commercial vehicles to improve road safety, reduce theft, and enhance fleet management. For prime mover operators, compliance isn't optional—it's a legal requirement.
          



          
            
              Vehicles Requiring GPS Tracking
            
            

- 
                  


                
                **Weight-based:** Vehicles weighing 7.5 tons or more
- 
                  
                
                **Customs vehicles:** All customs-registered transport
- 
                  
                
                **Specific cargo:** Vehicles transporting tobacco and alcohol products


            
              Most prime movers and container lorries fall under the 7.5+ ton requirement, making GPS mandatory for your fleet.
            


          

          
            APAD Permit & GPS Compliance
          

          


            GPS installation is required for **APAD permit application and renewal**. Without APAD certification, your operating license is at risk.
          



          
            Integration Requirements
          

          


            Your GPS system must link with multiple authorities:
          



          
            
              Required Authority Integrations
            
            

- **APAD** - Agensi Pengangkutan Awam Darat (Land Public Transport Agency)
- **LPK** - Lembaga Pelabuhan Klang (Port Klang Authority)
- **Westports & Northport** - For port access and operations
- **MPOB** - Malaysian Palm Oil Board (for palm oil transport)
