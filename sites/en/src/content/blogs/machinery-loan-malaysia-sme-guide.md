# Machinery Loan Malaysia: SME Guide to Equipment Financing (2026)

Buying machinery is expensive. Draining RM100,000-500,000 from your business account? That's risky. Here's how machinery loans let you grow without gambling your cash reserves.

## What Is a Machinery Loan?

A machinery loan finances equipment purchases - you pay monthly instead of upfront. The machinery itself usually serves as collateral, so you don't need additional property/guarantees in many cases.

## Types of Machinery Commonly Financed

### Manufacturing Equipment
- **CNC machines** - RM80,000-RM500,000
- **Injection molding** - RM100,000-RM800,000
- **Welding equipment** - RM20,000-RM150,000
- **Packaging machinery** - RM30,000-RM200,000
- **Production line equipment** - RM200,000-RM2,000,000+

### Construction Machinery
- **Excavators** - RM150,000-RM800,000
- **Bulldozers** - RM200,000-RM1,200,000
- **Backhoes** - RM80,000-RM300,000
- **Compactors** - RM50,000-RM400,000
- **Graders** - RM300,000-RM1,500,000

### Logistics & Warehouse
- **Forklifts** - RM40,000-RM200,000
- **Reach trucks** - RM80,000-RM250,000
- **Lorries (3-40 ton)** - RM60,000-RM500,000
- **Prime movers** - RM200,000-RM800,000
- **Container trailers** - RM80,000-RM300,000

### Food Processing
- **Commercial ovens** - RM30,000-RM150,000
- **Refrigeration units** - RM20,000-RM200,000
- **Bottling equipment** - RM100,000-RM500,000
- **Packaging lines** - RM80,000-RM400,000

## Bank vs Non-Bank Lenders

| Factor | Banks | Ing Heng Credit |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **Down Payment** | 20-40% | **0% options available** |
| **Approval Time** | 2-4 weeks | **48-72 hours** |
| **Machinery Age Limit** | Often won't finance >10 years | **Any age** |
| **Paperwork** | Extensive | Streamlined |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid criteria | Case-by-case assessment |

## Why 0% Down Payment Matters

**Example: RM300,000 CNC Machine**

**Bank route:**
- RM90,000 down payment (30%)
- RM210,000 financed over 60 months
- **Cash out immediately:** RM90,000

**Ing Heng route:**
- RM0 down payment
- RM300,000 financed over 60 months
- **Cash kept in business:** RM90,000

That RM90,000 covers:
- 3 months raw materials
- Staff salaries during setup
- Marketing for new capacity
- Emergency buffer

## Eligibility Requirements

**Basic criteria:**
- Business operating 1+ year (preferably)
- Consistent revenue stream
- Clear business need for machinery
- Reasonable debt levels

**We also approve:**
- Newer businesses with solid projections
- Companies upgrading old machinery
- Businesses expanding capacity
- SMEs with past credit challenges (assessed individually)

## Required Documents

**For Sdn Bhd:**
- Company SSM registration
- Director ICs
- Bank statements (6 months)
- Latest audited/management accounts
- Machinery quotation/proforma invoice
- Business plan (for larger amounts)

**For Sole Proprietor:**
- IC
- Business registration (if applicable)
- Personal bank statements (6 months)
- Income proof
- Machinery quotation
- Business operation proof

## Loan Tenure & Payment Structure

### Typical Tenures

| Machinery Type | Standard Tenure | Maximum Tenure |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Heavy construction (excavators, bulldozers) | 60 months | 84 months |
| Manufacturing equipment | 48 months | 72 months |
| Logistics vehicles | 48 months | 72 months |
| Light equipment | 36 months | 60 months |

**Longer tenure = Lower monthly payment** (but more interest paid total)  
**Shorter tenure = Higher monthly payment** (but less interest, faster ownership)

### Payment Example

**RM200,000 excavator, 60 months:**
- Monthly payment: ~RM3,900 (varies by interest rate)
- Total interest paid: ~RM34,000
- **Total cost:** ~RM234,000

Compare to:  
- Cash purchase: RM200,000 + opportunity cost of locked capital
- Rental: ~RM8,000/month × 60 = RM480,000 (with nothing to show at end)

## How Machinery Loans Improve Cash Flow

**Scenario: Manufacturing SME buying RM400,000 production line**

**Option A: Cash Purchase**
- Pay RM400,000 upfront
- No monthly loan payment
- **Risk:** Cash reserves depleted, can't handle unexpected costs

**Option B: Bank Loan (30% down)**
- Pay RM120,000 upfront
- RM280,000 financed, ~RM5,500/month
- **Challenge:** Still RM120,000 out immediately

**Option C: Ing Heng (0% down)**
- Pay RM0 upfront
- RM400,000 financed, ~RM7,800/month
- **Advantage:** All RM400,000 stays in business for operations

**Which is best?**  
Depends on your situation. If cash flow is tight or you're growing fast, Option C lets you preserve working capital.

## Tax Benefits of Machinery Loans

### Capital Allowance
Claim depreciation on machinery. Heavy machinery often qualifies for accelerated depreciation.

**Example:**  
RM300,000 excavator → Claim initial allowance 20% (RM60,000) + annual allowance 14% in Year 1.

### Interest Deduction
Loan interest is tax-deductible as business expense.

**Consult your tax advisor** - we provide all necessary documentation.

## Industry-Specific Guidance

### For Construction Companies

**CIDB requirements:**
To tender for government projects, you need machinery registered under your company. Financing lets you acquire equipment to meet CIDB class requirements without draining reserves.

**Seasonal cash flow:**
Construction payment cycles are long (60-90 days common). Machinery loans let you equip yourself without waiting for project payments.

### For Manufacturers

**Capacity expansion:**
Customer wants larger orders? Finance new machinery to meet demand without rejecting revenue opportunities.

**Technology upgrades:**
Older manual machines lose you competitive bids. Modern CNC equipment financed over 5 years pays for itself through higher-margin jobs.

### For Logistics Businesses

**Fleet expansion:**
E-commerce boom means more delivery volume. Finance additional lorries/vans to capture market growth.

**Replacement cycles:**
Lorries need replacing every 8-10 years. Financing spreads this cost, avoiding lump-sum capital hits.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Underestimating Total Cost
Calculate monthly payment × tenure. Compare to projected revenue from machinery. Leave buffer for slow months.

### 2. Overextending Tenure
Longer tenure = lower monthly payment, but you pay more interest total. Balance affordability vs total cost.

### 3. Ignoring Maintenance Costs
Budget for repairs, servicing, insurance. Your machinery loan covers purchase price, not ongoing operation.

### 4. Poor Equipment Selection
Choosing cheapest option often costs more long-term. Buy quality machinery that matches your actual usage.

## Application Process

**Step 1: Initial Inquiry (Same Day)**
WhatsApp/call with basic details:
- Machinery type and cost
- Your business profile
- Rough financial situation

**Step 2: Document Submission (1-2 Days)**
Submit required docs (IC, bank statements, quotation).

**Step 3: Assessment & Approval (48-72 Hours)**
We review and provide approval decision + terms.

**Step 4: Agreement (1 Day)**
Review terms, sign agreement, finalize details.

**Step 5: Equipment Delivery (Same Day)**
Supplier gets payment → You receive machinery → Start using immediately.

**Total timeline: 5-7 days** from first contact to equipment in your facility.

## What If I'm Rejected by Banks?

**Common bank rejection reasons:**
- Company too new (<3 years)
- Equipment too old (>10 years)
- Past credit issues
- Owner age >60
- Debt-to-income too high

**We assess differently:**
- **Company age:** We look at director experience + business viability, not just years registered
- **Equipment age:** We finance any age if equipment is functional
- **Credit history:** Past issues don't auto-disqualify - we assess current capacity to repay
- **Owner age:** No age limit - we've financed machinery for 70+ year-old business owners
- **Debt levels:** We consider cash flow and revenue, not just existing debt

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I finance used machinery?**  
Yes. We finance new and used equipment of any age. Provide equipment details, and we'll assess.

**Q: Do I need to use a specific supplier?**  
No. You choose your supplier/equipment. We finance based on quotation/proforma invoice.

**Q: What if the machinery I want is from overseas?**  
We can finance imported machinery. Documentation requirements slightly different - contact us for details.

**Q: Can I add machinery to an existing loan?**  
Possibly. Depends on current loan status and additional amount needed. We'll assess and advise.

**Q: What happens if machinery breaks down during loan period?**  
The loan continues - you're still responsible for payments. This is why we recommend insuring machinery. Some loan packages include insurance options.

**Q: Can I upgrade machinery mid-term?**  
You can sell current machinery (with lender consent), settle remaining loan balance, and apply for new financing for upgraded equipment.
