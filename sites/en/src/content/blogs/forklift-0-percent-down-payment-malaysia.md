What Is 0% Down Payment Forklift Financing?
          

          


            Traditional equipment financing requires **10-30% down payment** upfront. For a RM80,000 electric forklift, that means RM8,000-RM24,000 in immediate cash outlay. 0% down payment financing eliminates this barrier, allowing you to acquire essential warehouse equipment without draining your working capital.
          



          


            At Ing Heng Credit, we understand warehouse operators face competing priorities: inventory, wages, rent, and utilities. 0% down payment forklift financing lets you **preserve cash for operations** while still acquiring the equipment needed to grow.

#### Preserve Working Capital


                Keep RM10,000-RM25,000 in your business for inventory, wages, marketing, or emergency expenses instead of tying it up in equipment down payment.

#### Electric Forklifts (Recommended for Indoor Warehouses)


              

- Zero emissions - compliant with DOSH 2024 regulations
- Lower operating costs - electricity cheaper than diesel
- Quieter operation - better for indoor worker comfort
- Higher upfront cost but 40-88% more efficient than diesel
- Lithium-ion batteries: 3,000-6,000 cycles (up to 10 years lifespan)


            
            
              

#### Diesel Forklifts (For Heavy-Duty Outdoor Applications)


              

- Lower initial purchase price
- Better for outdoor, heavy-capacity lifting
- Higher fuel and maintenance costs over time
- Not suitable for indoor use due to emissions
- Declining market share due to environmental regulations
