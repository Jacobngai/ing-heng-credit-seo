     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     # Prime Mover Financing Malaysia: 0% Deposit, 100% Financing Available

Need a **prime mover** for your logistics or port operations business? Want to finance without paying any deposit upfront?

This guide explains everything about prime mover financing in Malaysia. We cover 0% deposit options, approval requirements, costs, and how to get fast approval for your equipment.

**What you will learn:**

• How to get 100% financing with zero deposit

• Eligibility requirements for prime mover loans

• Cost comparison: financing vs leasing vs renting

• Step-by-step application process

• Documents needed for fast approval

Let’s start with the basics.

## What is Prime Mover Financing?

**Prime mover financing** is a loan to buy a truck head (also called tractor unit or truck tractor). The prime mover is the front part of a semi-trailer truck that pulls cargo containers or trailers.

### How Prime Mover Financing Works

**Simple explanation:**

• You choose the prime mover you need (new or used)

• We finance up to 100% of the purchase price

• You pay monthly installments over 3-7 years

• You own the equipment at the end of loan tenure

• The prime mover is the collateral (security for loan)

**Key advantage:** You start operating immediately without large upfront payment.

### Types of Prime Movers We Finance

**Standard Prime Movers:**

• 4x2 (2-axle) - Port container hauling

• 6x4 (3-axle) - Heavy cargo, long distance

• 6x2 (2.5-axle) - Medium duty hauling

**Brands We Finance:**

• Mercedes-Benz Actros

• Volvo FH/FM series

• Scania R/S/P series

• MAN TGX/TGS

• DAF XF/CF

• Hino 700 series

• UD Trucks Quester

• Isuzu Giga

• Used European/Japanese brands

**Price Ranges:**

• Used prime movers: RM 150,000 - 250,000

• New prime movers: RM 300,000 - 500,000

• Premium models: RM 500,000 - 800,000

We finance all types, new or used, up to 10 years old.

## Benefits of Prime Mover Financing for Logistics Operations

Why finance instead of renting or leasing?

### 1. Zero Deposit Required (For Qualified Applicants)

**Traditional banks require:**

• 10-30% down payment

• RM 30,000-100,000 upfront for RM 300,000 prime mover

• Immediate cash outflow

**We offer:**

• 0% deposit for qualified businesses

• 100% financing available

• Preserve working capital for operations

• Start earning immediately

**Who qualifies for 0% deposit?**

• Good credit score (CTOS/CCRIS 650+)

• Business operating 1+ years

• Stable revenue stream

• Low debt-to-income ratio

### 2. Ownership from Day One

**Renting a prime mover:**

• RM 8,000-12,000/month rental

• No asset at end

• Total cost after 5 years: RM 480,000-720,000

• Still need to rent after 5 years

**Financing instead:**

• Total cost: RM 348,000

• **Savings: RM 132,000-372,000 over 5 years**

### 3. Build Business Assets

**Your prime mover is valuable:**

• Appears on company balance sheet

• Increases business valuation

• Can be used as collateral for future loans

• Sells for good resale value (RM 100,000-200,000 after 5-7 years)

**Versus renting:**

• Zero assets accumulated

• Nothing to show after years of payments

• Harder to get future financing

### 4. Tax Benefits

### 5. Predictable Monthly Costs

**Fixed monthly payments:**

• Same amount every month for entire tenure

• Easy to budget and plan cash flow

• No surprise rent increases

• Lock in your rate for 5-7 years

**Rental costs increase:**

• 5-10% increase annually

• Hard to budget long-term

• Forced to accept higher rates

### 6. Fast Approval (Compared to Banks)

• 2-4 weeks approval process

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get prime mover financing with 0% deposit in Malaysia?

Yes, we offer up to 100% financing for qualified applicants. Zero deposit financing is available for businesses with good credit score (700+), established operations (1+ years), and stable revenue. Most applicants with credit score 600+ can get 90% financing with 10% deposit. Contact us to check your eligibility for zero deposit options.

### What is the approval process for prime mover financing?

Our approval process is fast compared to traditional banks. Submit your application with business documents, financial statements, and equipment quotation. We provide initial response within 1-2 business days after reviewing your credit and financials. Complete approval takes 3-7 business days. Banks typically take 2-4 weeks for the same process.

### How much does prime mover financing cost?

For a RM 300,000 prime mover with 0% deposit over 60 months, monthly payment is approximately RM 5,800-6,500 depending on your credit profile and interest rate (7-8% annually). With 10% deposit (RM 30,000), monthly payments reduce to RM 5,200-5,800. Total interest cost over 5 years ranges from RM 45,000-65,000.

### Can I finance used prime movers?

Yes, we finance both new and used prime movers up to 10 years old. Used units typically cost RM 150,000-250,000 versus RM 300,000-500,000 for new models, making financing easier to obtain. Used prime movers must pass Puspakom B5 inspection and be roadworthy. We finance all major brands including Mercedes, Volvo, Scania, MAN, DAF, Hino, UD Trucks, and Isuzu.

### What documents do I need for prime mover financing?

You need business documents (SSM certificate, business license), financial documents (6 months bank statements, tax returns), personal IC and bank statements, and equipment quotation with specifications. For zero deposit applications, we require 12 months bank statements and stronger financial proof. We help you prepare everything needed for fast approval.

### How long is the financing tenure for prime movers?

Financing tenure ranges from 36 to 84 months (3-7 years). Most applicants choose 60 months (5 years) for balanced monthly payments and total interest cost. Longer tenure (72-84 months) means lower monthly payments but higher total interest. Shorter tenure (36-48 months) means higher monthly payments but lower total interest. We help you choose the best tenure for your cash flow.

### Is prime mover financing cheaper than leasing?

Yes, financing costs much less long-term. Over 5 years, financing a RM 300,000 prime mover costs RM 350,000-380,000 total (including interest) and you own a RM 150,000 asset. Leasing the same unit costs RM 450,000-600,000 with zero ownership at the end. Financing saves RM 100,000-250,000 and you own the equipment. Net cost is 2-3 times lower than leasing.
