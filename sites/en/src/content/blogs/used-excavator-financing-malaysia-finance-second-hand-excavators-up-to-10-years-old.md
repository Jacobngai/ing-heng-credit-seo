  #  Used Excavator Financing Malaysia: Finance Second-Hand Excavators Up to 10 Years Old 

  Finance used excavators up to 10 years old in Malaysia. 0% deposit available. Learn age limits, interest rates, valuation process, and approval requirements for second-hand excavators. 

     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     ## Why Buy a Used Excavator Instead of New?

Many Malaysian contractors choose used excavators over new machines. The cost savings are significant:

**Cost Advantages:**

• Used excavators cost 40-65% less than new units

• Lower down payment amount (RM 15K vs RM 80K)

• Faster return on investment

• Better cash flow for other business needs

• Less depreciation (new excavators lose 25-30% value in first year)

**Immediate Availability:**

• New excavators have 4-8 month waiting periods

• Used machines are ready to work immediately

• No manufacturing delays or supply chain issues

• Start earning revenue within 1 week of purchase

**Proven Performance:**

• Used excavators have established maintenance history

• Known reliability record (unlike untested new models)

• Previous owner has already fixed initial issues

• Proven durability in Malaysian conditions

**Example Savings:**

A new Caterpillar 320 costs RM 650,000. A 5-year-old model costs RM 280,000-350,000. You save RM 300,000-370,000 while getting the same digging capacity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I finance an excavator with high engine hours?

**Answer:** Yes, but it depends on the brand and maintenance. Caterpillar and Komatsu excavators with 8,000-10,000 hours can still be financed if:

• Complete service records available

• No major component failures

• Recent major service completed

• Inspection passes our standards

• Higher down payment (25-30%)

Some Chinese brands are rejected above 6,000 hours due to reliability concerns.

### What if the excavator needs repairs before disbursement?

**Answer:** We have three options:

• **Seller repairs before purchase** (best option)

• **Escrow disbursement:** We hold back 10-20% until repairs complete

• **Accept as-is with price reduction** (you do repairs after)

For repairs under RM 5,000, option 1 is easiest. For major repairs (RM 10,000+), negotiate price reduction.

### Can I trade in my old excavator?

**Answer:** Yes! Trade-in process:

• We evaluate your current excavator

• Determine trade-in value based on condition

• Trade-in value becomes your down payment

• You finance the difference

**Example:**

• New excavator: RM 280,000

• Your trade-in value: RM 80,000

• Down payment needed: RM 0 (trade-in covers it)

• Finance amount: RM 200,000

This works well if your old excavator is well-maintained.

### Do you finance excavators from auction sales?

**Answer:** Yes, but with conditions:

• Inspection is mandatory (no exceptions)

• Down payment: 30-40% (higher risk)

• Interest rate: +1-2% higher than normal

• Age limit: 7 years maximum

• Premium brands only (CAT, Komatsu, Hitachi)

Auction excavators often have unknown history, so we’re more cautious. If inspection passes and brand is good, approval is possible.

### Can I get financing if my business is new (under 2 years)?

**Answer:** Possible but challenging. Requirements:

• Strong personal credit score (700+)

• Higher down payment (25-30%)

• Personal guarantee from owner

• Evidence of contracts or revenue

• Relevant industry experience

Many contractors start as sole proprietors before incorporating. We look at your personal background, not just company age.

### What happens if I want to sell the excavator before loan is paid off?

**Answer:** Two options:

**Option 1: Buyer pays off your loan**

• Buyer pays us outstanding balance directly

• Pays you the difference (equity)

• We release our interest/lien

• Ownership transfers to buyer

**Option 2: You settle loan first**

• You pay us full outstanding balance

• We release interest/lien

• You sell excavator freely

• No early settlement penalty

Most buyers prefer Option 1 for smooth process.

### Can I refinance my existing used excavator loan for better terms?

**Answer:** Yes! Refinancing requirements:

• Current loan must be 12+ months old

• Excavator must be under 10 years old

• Good payment history (no late payments)

• Excavator in good condition

**Benefits of refinancing:**

• Lower interest rate (save RM 10,000-30,000)

• Extend tenure (reduce monthly payment)

• Cash-out equity (for repairs or new equipment)

Many customers refinance after 2-3 years when rates drop or business improves.
