Malaysia's Climate: A Battery Killer
          

          


            Warehouse operators in Shah Alam, Klang, and across Malaysia face a hidden challenge: **tropical heat destroys forklift batteries faster** than in temperate countries. With average temperatures of 32C and 80% humidity, your batteries work harder and die sooner.
          



          


            The Malaysian forklift battery market was worth **US$25 million in 2019** with 7% annual growth through 2025. This growth reflects both the expansion of warehousing and the constant need for battery replacements due to climate stress.
          



          
            
              Climate Impact on Your Bottom Line

                Lead-acid batteries last **2-3 years in Malaysia** vs 5+ years in cooler climates
- 
                  
                
                Battery capacity degrades **30-50% faster** in hot, humid conditions
- 
                  
                
                More frequent replacements = **higher annual costs**
- 
                  
                
                Higher electricity consumption to charge degraded batteries


          

          
            Lithium-Ion: Built for Malaysia's Heat
          

          
            While lead-acid batteries suffer in Malaysia's climate, **lithium-ion technology thrives**. Allied Forklift (M) Sdn. Bhd., which evolved from diesel to EV specialist since 2020, pioneered EP iMOW Lithium-Ion Battery Technology in Malaysia specifically for local conditions.

#### Handles Heat Better


                

Lithium-ion maintains performance up to 45C, making it ideal for Malaysian warehouses without air conditioning.

#### 3,000 to 6,000 Cycles


                

Lasts up to 10 years with one shift daily use - 3x longer than lead-acid in tropical climates.

#### 40% More Efficient


                

Up to 40% more efficient than lead-acid, 88% more efficient than diesel. Real savings of RM 15,000-25,000 annually.

#### Fast Charging


                

Charges in 1-2 hours vs 8 hours for lead-acid. Opportunity charging during breaks eliminates battery swapping.
