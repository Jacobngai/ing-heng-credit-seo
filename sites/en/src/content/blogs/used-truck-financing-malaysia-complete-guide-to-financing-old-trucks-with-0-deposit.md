  #  Used Truck Financing Malaysia: Complete Guide to Financing Old Trucks with 0% Deposit 

  Finance used trucks up to 10+ years old in Malaysia with 0% deposit. Learn about approval rates, interest rates, and complete process for second-hand truck financing. 

     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     ## Why Choose Used Truck Financing Over New?

When you watch successful logistics operators building their fleets, most start with used trucks. The math is simple:

**Cost Reality:**

• New truck: RM 200,000-350,000

• 5-year-old truck: RM 120,000-200,000 (40-50% savings)

• 8-year-old truck: RM 80,000-140,000 (60-70% savings)

• 10+ year-old truck: RM 50,000-100,000 (70-80% savings)

**The 0% Deposit Advantage:**
Most operators struggle with the massive down payments banks demand. We solve this with **0% deposit financing** - meaning you can start operations without emptying your bank account.

**Ahmad’s Story:** Ahmad needed a truck for his construction material delivery business. Banks wanted RM 40,000 down payment for a RM 160,000 truck. We approved his 7-year-old truck with **0% deposit** and 100% financing. He started earning RM 12,000 monthly immediately instead of waiting 8 months to save the down payment.

**Immediate Revenue Generation:**

• New trucks: 3-6 month waiting period

• Used trucks: Drive away and earn today

• No manufacturing delays

• No supply chain issues blocking your income

**Better Cash Flow Management:**
When you finance a used truck with 0% deposit, every ringgit stays in your business for:

• Fuel and maintenance

• Driver salaries

• Insurance and road tax

• Working capital for operations

• Emergency repairs

## Used Truck Financing: No Age Limits Like Banks

Banks have rigid age restrictions. We don’t. Here’s why this matters:

### Banks vs Us: Age Acceptance

**Traditional Banks:**

• Maximum age: 5 years old

• Automatic rejection: 6+ years old

• No exceptions

• Miss out on 70% of affordable trucks

**Ing Heng Credit:**

• Age considered: 10+ years old

• Assessment based: Working condition, not arbitrary age

• Individual evaluation: Each truck judged on merits

• Access granted: To affordable trucks banks reject

### Real Examples of Age Flexibility

**Case 1: 12-Year-Old Hino Still Productive**
Contractor Rajan bought a 12-year-old Hino WU300 for RM 65,000. Banks said “too old.” We said “let’s inspect it.”

**Inspection Results:**

• Engine: Well-maintained, recent overhaul

• Transmission: Smooth operation

• Chassis: Solid, no structural issues

• Service history: Regular maintenance records

**Outcome:** Approved with 25% down payment (Rajan chose this vs 0% for better rates). The truck operates 6 days a week hauling sand and cement. Still running strong after 2 years.

**Case 2: 15-Year-Old Mercedes Still Earning**
Transport operator Kumar needed a container truck. Found a 15-year-old Mercedes Actros for RM 95,000. Banks laughed. We inspected it.

**Key Findings:**

• Engine rebuild: Done 6 months ago (RM 35,000 investment)

• Hydraulic system: Recently serviced

• Tires: Good condition

• Driver: Experienced operator who knows the truck

**Result:** Approved! Kumar hauls containers from Port Klang daily. Revenue: RM 400-500 per trip, 4-5 trips weekly. The “too old” truck generates RM 8,000-10,000 monthly.

### Why We Approve “Old” Trucks Banks Reject

**1. Professional Inspection Over Age Prejudice**
We send licensed inspectors who assess:

• Engine compression and performance

• Transmission and drivetrain condition

• Chassis integrity and rust levels

• Electrical systems functionality

• Safety equipment compliance

Age is just a number. Condition is everything.

**2. Business Viability Assessment**
We evaluate:

• Your experience operating trucks

• Contracts or consistent work lined up

• Maintenance capabilities (in-house vs outsourced)

• Financial stability to handle repairs

• Insurance and safety compliance

**3. Asset Value Based on Reality**
A 10-year-old well-maintained Hino is worth more than a 3-year-old poorly maintained truck. We assess actual market value, not age-based depreciation tables.

## 0% Deposit Financing: How It Works

Banks demand 20-40% down payment. We offer **0% deposit** options. Here’s the structure:

### 0% Deposit Qualification Criteria

**Business Requirements:**

• Operating 2+ years (established track record)

• Clean payment history on existing loans

• Steady monthly income (contracts/regular customers)

• Professional insurance coverage

**Truck Requirements:**

• Japanese brands preferred (Hino, Isuzu, Fuso)

• Good maintenance history

• Clean accident record

• Passes professional inspection

**Credit Requirements:**

• CCRIS score 650+ (we check for you)

• No major defaults in past 2 years

• Debt service ratio under 60%

• Clear explanation for any credit issues

### 0% Deposit vs Traditional Financing

**Example: RM 120,000 Used Hino (6 years old)**

**Bank Financing (30% deposit):**

Purchase Price: RM 120,000
Down Payment: RM 36,000 (30%)
Loan Amount: RM 84,000
Interest Rate: 4.5%
Tenure: 60 months

Initial Cash Needed: RM 36,000
Monthly Payment: RM 1,565
**Our 0% Deposit Financing:**

Purchase Price: RM 120,000
Down Payment: RM 0 (0%)
Loan Amount: RM 120,000
Interest Rate: 5.8%
Tenure: 60 months

Initial Cash Needed: RM 0
Monthly Payment: RM 2,298
**The Trade-Off Analysis:**

• Higher monthly payment: RM 733 more

• But RM 36,000 cash stays in your business

• Use that RM 36,000 for: spare truck, working capital, expansion

**Break-Even Calculation:**
RM 36,000 saved ÷ RM 733 extra monthly = 49 months to break even

If your truck generates RM 8,000+ monthly, the extra RM 733 is just 9% of revenue. Worth it to keep RM 36,000 in cash.

### Who Should Choose 0% Deposit?

**Perfect For:**

• New logistics operators (cash flow priority)

• Businesses expanding fleet size

• Companies with seasonal cash flow

• Operators planning multiple truck purchases

• Businesses needing emergency reserves

**Consider Deposit If:**

• You have surplus cash

• Want lower monthly payments

• Prefer conservative debt levels

• Operating margins are tight

## 0% Deposit vs Down Payment: Which is Right for You?

The choice depends on your cash position and business strategy:

### When to Choose 0% Deposit

**Perfect Scenarios:**

• **Cash Flow Critical:** Need cash for daily operations

• **Multiple Investments:** Planning to buy several trucks

• **Seasonal Business:** Need reserves for slow periods

• **Emergency Fund:** Want backup cash for repairs

• **Growth Mode:** Expanding operations quickly

**Real Example - Contractor Lee:**
Lee builds small housing projects. His cash flow varies:

• **Peak months:** RM 50,000 revenue

• **Slow months:** RM 15,000 revenue

• **Average:** RM 30,000 monthly

With RM 150,000 truck:

• **Option A:** 30% deposit (RM 45,000), monthly payment RM 2,100

• **Option B:** 0% deposit, monthly payment RM 3,200

Lee chose 0% deposit because:

• RM 45,000 cash provides 3-month emergency buffer

• Can handle slow months without stress

• Uses saved cash to buy tools and equipment

• Higher monthly payment manageable during good months

### When to Choose Down Payment

**Smart Scenarios:**

• **Cash Available:** Have surplus cash earning low returns

• **Conservative Approach:** Prefer lower debt levels

• **Stable Income:** Consistent monthly revenue

• **Lower Rate Priority:** Want best interest rate possible

**Example - Transport Operator Susan:**
Susan has established container transport business:

• **Monthly Revenue:** RM 45,000 consistently

• **Cash Reserves:** RM 80,000 in business account

• **Growth Plan:** Cautious, steady expansion

For RM 120,000 truck:

• Susan chose 25% deposit (RM 30,000)

• Monthly payment: RM 1,950 vs RM 2,850 (0% deposit)

• Interest rate: 5.8% vs 6.5% (0% deposit)

**Susan’s Logic:**

• RM 30,000 down payment still leaves RM 50,000 emergency cash

• Lower monthly payment improves cash flow

• Better interest rate saves RM 4,500 over loan term

• Conservative debt level supports business stability

### Decision Framework

**Ask Yourself:**

• 
**How much cash do I really need for operations?**

• 3-month expenses minimum

• Seasonal variation buffer

• Repair and maintenance reserve

• 
**What’s my monthly revenue stability?**

• Consistent = can handle higher payments

• Variable = keep more cash available

• 
**What are my growth plans?**

• Multiple trucks planned = preserve cash

• Single truck investment = deposit okay

• 
**What’s my risk tolerance?**

• Conservative = down payment

• Aggressive growth = 0% deposit

### Hybrid Approach

Many operators choose middle ground:

**10-15% Deposit Strategy:**

• Some skin in the game (better rates)

• Preserve most cash for operations

• Balance monthly payment with cash flow

• Good compromise for most situations

**Example Calculation (RM 100,000 truck):**

0% deposit: RM 0 down, RM 2,400/month
15% deposit: RM 15,000 down, RM 2,100/month  
30% deposit: RM 30,000 down, RM 1,850/month
Sweet spot often at 10-15% deposit.

## Interest Rate Optimization Strategies

Your interest rate isn’t fixed. Here’s how to get the best possible rate:

### Factors You Can Control

## Common Approval Challenges and Solutions

Even with flexible criteria, some applications face hurdles. Here’s how to overcome them:

### Challenge 1: New Business (Under 2 Years)

**Typical Bank Response:** “Come back after 2 years of operation.”

**Our Approach:**

• **Personal Credit:** Strong personal CCRIS compensates

• **Industry Experience:** Previous employment in logistics/transport

• **Customer Contracts:** Signed agreements show viable business

• **Conservative Loan:** Lower loan-to-value ratio

• **Guarantor Option:** Additional security if needed

**Success Example:**
New logistics company, 8 months old:

• **Owner:** Ex-DHL manager with 12 years experience

• **Contracts:** 3 confirmed customers, RM 8,000 monthly guaranteed

• **Personal Credit:** 710 score, clean history

• **Solution:** 20% deposit, 6.5% rate approved

### Challenge 2: Poor Credit History

**Common Issues:**

• Late payments on previous loans

• Credit card defaults

• Business loan difficulties

• CCRIS score below 600

**Our Solutions:**

• **Explanation Letter:** Context for credit issues

• **Recent Improvement:** 12+ months clean payment record

• **Secured Approach:** Higher deposit reduces risk

• **Co-Guarantor:** Additional party with clean credit

• **Asset Security:** Additional collateral if available

**Recovery Example:**
Contractor with bankruptcy 3 years ago:

• **Current Status:** Discharged, rebuilding credit

• **Business:** Strong cash flow, good contracts

• **Approach:** 40% deposit, shorter term, higher rate

• **Result:** Approved at 9.5% rate, truck profitable

### Challenge 3: Truck Age/Condition Concerns

**When Inspections Reveal Issues:**

• **Minor Problems:** Repair before disbursement

• **Moderate Issues:** Adjust loan terms

• **Major Problems:** Reject truck, find alternative

**Problem-Solving Approach:**

• **Cost Assessment:** Repair cost vs truck value

• **Timeline Impact:** Can repairs be completed quickly?

• **Long-term View:** Will truck be reliable post-repair?

**Real Example:**
8-year-old Mercedes needed RM 8,000 transmission service:

• **Option 1:** Reject application

• **Option 2:** Conditional approval (repair first)

• **Option 3:** Seller reduces price by RM 8,000

• **Chosen:** Option 3, seller adjusted price

### Challenge 4: Seasonal Income Variation

**Industries Affected:**

• Construction (monsoon impact)

• Tourism-related logistics

• Palm oil seasonal cycles

**Our Adaptations:**

• **Annual Income:** Average monthly over 12 months

• **Off Season:** RM 20,000/month (6 months)

• **Approval:** Based on average, with cash reserve requirement

### Challenge 5: Limited Documentation

**Missing Records Common For:**

• Recent immigrants

**Alternative Documentation:**

• **Bank Statements:** Primary income evidence

• **Customer Letters:** Testimonials about regular business

• **Cash Flow Tracking:** 3-month documented records

• **Asset Verification:** Existing equipment owned

• **Reference Checks:** Supplier and customer contacts

**Documentation Workaround Example:**
Small construction supplier, poor records:

• **Bank Statements:** Showed consistent deposits

• **Customer Contracts:** 2 signed agreements

• **Asset Evidence:** Owned excavator and land

• **Approach:** Conservative loan terms, approved
