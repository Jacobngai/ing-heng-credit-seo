  #  Concrete Mixer Financing Malaysia: 0% Deposit Construction Equipment Loans 

  Get concrete mixer financing with zero deposit in Malaysia. Finance up to 100% of mixer truck value. Fast approval for new and used cement mixers from 1-year-old businesses. 

     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     ## Concrete Mixer Financing Malaysia: Get Your Mixer Truck with 0% Deposit

Need a concrete mixer truck for your construction or ready-mix business? Getting financing should not delay your concrete operations. At Ing Heng Credit, we offer concrete mixer financing with zero deposit required and loans up to 100% of equipment value.

Whether you need a small transit mixer for site operations or a large concrete truck for ready-mix delivery, we help Malaysian contractors and concrete suppliers access the mixing equipment they need to serve customers reliably.

**Why concrete businesses choose us for mixer financing:**

• 0% deposit required for qualified applicants

• Finance up to 100% of mixer truck value

• Fast approval compared to banks (we respond much quicker)

• High success rate for qualified businesses

• Used mixers accepted (up to 10 years old)

• Competitive rates from 6.5% per annum

• New businesses accepted (1 year old minimum)

**40 years financing heavy equipment for Malaysian contractors.**

## Why Finance a Concrete Mixer Instead of Renting?

### 1. Stop Paying Rental Fees Forever

**Rental costs add up fast:**

• Small mixer (6m³): RM 800-1,200/day

• Medium mixer (8m³): RM 1,000-1,500/day

• Large mixer (10m³): RM 1,200-1,800/day

**Example: 8m³ mixer truck rental**

• Daily rental: RM 1,200

• 20 working days/month: RM 24,000

• 2-year period: RM 576,000

• **Result:** RM 576,000 spent, zero assets owned

**Instead, finance with 0% deposit:**

• Mixer truck price: RM 450,000

• Finance 100%: RM 450,000 loan

• Monthly payment (60 months, 7% p.a.): RM 8,910

• **After 5 years:** Own RM 450,000 mixer, save RM 470,000

### 2. Own the Asset from Day One

When you finance a concrete mixer:

• Build company assets for financial strength

• Depreciation benefits for tax optimization

• Use mixer for multiple clients (not restricted)

• Sell or trade-in when upgrading fleet

• No daily rental charges reducing profit margins

### 3. Win More Ready-Mix Contracts

Many large construction projects require:

• Proof of owned delivery equipment (not rental dependency)

• Reliable concrete supply schedules

• Financial stability (assets demonstrate capacity)

• Long-term service capability guarantees

**Owning your concrete mixer makes you more competitive** for major ready-mix supply contracts.

### 4. Better Business Cash Flow Management

Spread the cost over 36-84 months:

• Manage seasonal construction patterns

• Align payments with monthly revenue

• Preserve working capital for cement and aggregates

• Pay from operating profits, not cash reserves
