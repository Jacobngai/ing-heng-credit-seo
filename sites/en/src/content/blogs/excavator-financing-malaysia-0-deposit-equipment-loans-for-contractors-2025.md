  #  Excavator Financing Malaysia: 0% Deposit Equipment Loans for Contractors 2025 

  Get excavator financing in Malaysia with 0% deposit and 100% financing. Fast approval for new and used excavators up to 15 years old. No bank rejection here. 

     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     # Excavator Financing Malaysia: Get Your Equipment with 0% Deposit

When you watch that RM 15,000 rental check leave your account every month for the excavator you don’t own, does your stomach knot up thinking: “I just paid for another month of building someone else’s wealth while my own projects wait?”

When the rental company calls at 4:30 PM demanding their excavator back by 5 PM, and you have a full day of foundation work scheduled for tomorrow morning, do you feel that panic grip your chest knowing you’ll lose the contract because of their schedule?

When you calculate your project profits and realize RM 18,000 per month goes to equipment rental—money that could be yours if you owned the excavator—does that frustration burn in your throat?

**Stop building other people’s businesses. Start building your own.**

## Your Equipment. Your Schedule. Your Revenue.

At Ing Heng Credit, we understand the rental trap that keeps contractors stuck. That’s why we offer **0% deposit excavator financing** with **100% financing options** that let you own your equipment from day one.

No more rental schedules controlling your projects.
No more monthly payments disappearing into rental companies.
No more missed opportunities because equipment isn’t available.

**Your excavator. Your timeline. Your profits.**

## The Rental Trap That’s Costing You Thousands

### The Hidden Cost of Renting

Ahmad, a foundation contractor from Klang, was paying RM 16,000 monthly to rent a CAT 320D excavator. After 18 months, he’d paid RM 288,000 in rental fees.

**For that same amount, he could have owned the excavator.**

But the rental company made it seem convenient: “No maintenance worries, no down payment, just pay monthly.”

What they didn’t tell him:

• He built zero equity despite paying RM 288,000

• Every project profit was reduced by RM 16,000 monthly

• His business couldn’t grow because he didn’t own assets

• When he needed the excavator most, it wasn’t always available

### The Equipment Availability Problem

**Rental companies prioritize their profits, not your projects.**

• Need the excavator for weekend emergency work? “Sorry, it’s booked.”

• Want to extend your rental by 2 days? “Next customer is waiting.”

• Equipment breaks down? “Replacement will be ready next week.”

**When you don’t own the equipment, you don’t control your business.**

### The Growth Limitation

Here’s what rental companies won’t tell you: **You can’t build a serious construction business on rented equipment.**

Banks and investors look at your asset base when considering larger project financing. If you own RM 500,000 in equipment, you can bid on RM 2 million projects.

If you own nothing but pay RM 16,000 monthly in rental? You’re stuck bidding on small projects forever.

## 0% Deposit: Your Path to Equipment Ownership

### What 0% Deposit Really Means

**Zero upfront payment. Finance 100% of the equipment value.**

• Excavator costs RM 350,000? Finance RM 350,000.

• Need RM 500,000 for a premium CAT excavator? Finance the full amount.

• Want to preserve your cash for other business needs? Finance everything.

**This is your major advantage over competitors still trapped in rental cycles.**

### Why We Offer 0% Deposit When Others Don’t

**Traditional banks require 20-30% deposit because:**

• They don’t understand equipment-based businesses

• They fear equipment depreciation

• They use outdated lending criteria

**We offer 0% deposit because:**

• We understand construction cash flow reality

• We know quality excavators hold value for decades

• We assess business potential, not just financial statements

**40+ years financing excavators taught us: The equipment pays for itself when the contractor owns it.**

### Real Customer Example: Ahmad’s Success Story

Ahmad needed a used CAT 320D (12 years old) for his foundation contracting business.

**Bank Response:** “Rejected. Equipment too old. Minimum 30% deposit required.”

**Our Response:** “Approved. 0% deposit. 100% financing.”

**Results after 24 months:**

• Monthly payment: RM 8,500 (vs RM 16,000 rental)

• Savings: RM 7,500 monthly

• Additional projects: 3 larger contracts (asset-backed bidding)

• Business growth: From RM 80,000 to RM 180,000 monthly revenue

**Ahmad built equity while others built rental company profits.**

## We Finance Equipment Banks Reject

### 10+ Year Equipment: Our Specialty

**Banks say:** “Sorry, equipment must be under 5 years old.”

**We say:** “Show us a well-maintained 15-year-old excavator and we’ll finance it.”

**Why age doesn’t matter to us:**

• Quality excavators run 20,000+ hours (10-15 years)

• Proper maintenance matters more than age

• Experienced contractors know equipment condition better than banks

• Some of our most successful clients operate 15-20 year old equipment

### Equipment We’ve Financed Recently

**CAT 966D Wheel Loader - 13 years old**

• Bank rejection: “Too old”

• Our approval: 0% deposit, 84 months

• Customer outcome: Still running strong after 3 years

**Komatsu PC350 - 14 years old**

• Bank rejection: “High risk”

• Our approval: 15% deposit, 72 months

• Customer outcome: Contractor expanded to 3-unit fleet

**Hitachi EX200 - 16 years old**

• Bank rejection: “Beyond financing criteria”

• Our approval: 20% deposit, 60 months

• Customer outcome: Equipment paid itself off in 24 months

**The pattern: Banks see age. We see opportunity.**

## Fast Approval When Time Matters

### Why Speed Matters in Construction

**Construction opportunities don’t wait for bank approvals.**

• Government tenders have tight deadline requirements

• Private projects move to contractors who can start immediately

• Equipment breakdowns need immediate replacement

**When you need excavator financing fast, banks move slowly:**

• 2-4 weeks approval process

• Multiple committee approvals required

• Endless documentation requests

### Our Rapid Approval Process

**Day 1: Submit Application**

• WhatsApp: +60175700889

• Provide: IC copy + equipment quotation

• Response: Within 2 hours (business hours)

**Day 1-2: Credit Assessment**

**Real contractors need real solutions, not bank bureaucracy.**

### Customer Success: Emergency Replacement

**Situation:** Rahman’s 8-year-old excavator broke down completely. Major repair would cost RM 80,000 and take 6 weeks.

He had a RM 200,000 foundation project starting in 5 days.

**Bank Timeline:** 3-4 weeks for loan approval
**Our Timeline:** 48 hours from application to approval

**Outcome:** Rahman got a replacement excavator in 4 days, completed the project on time, and earned RM 45,000 profit instead of losing the contract.

**When opportunities knock, we answer the door.**

Every month you continue renting is another month of building someone else’s wealth instead of your own.

Every project you complete with rented equipment is a missed opportunity to build asset value.

Every time equipment isn’t available when you need it, you lose money and reputation.

**The solution is simple: Own your equipment.**

With **0% deposit financing** and **100% financing options**, there’s no financial barrier to ownership. With our **fast approval process**, there’s no time barrier either.

**The only question is: Will you keep building other people’s businesses, or start building your own?**
