## Financing Cold Chain Lorries: Key Considerations



      

### 1. Higher Equipment Cost = Higher Financing Need



      

Cold chain lorries at RM280,000-RM550,000 represent significant investment:
      
• 0% down payment preserves RM100,000-RM200,000 per lorry
      
• Preserved capital critical for:
      
  - Backup power generators (essential for cold chain reliability)
      
  - Temperature monitoring systems
      
  - APAD permits and licensing
      
  - Sanitation and cleaning equipment



      

### 2. Refrigeration Unit Maintenance Costs



      

Cold chain lorries require specialized maintenance:
      
• Refrigeration unit servicing: Every 3-4 months
      
• Compressor replacement: Every 5-7 years (RM25,000-RM40,000)
      
• Insulation inspection: Annually
      
• Temperature sensor calibration: Every 6 months



      

**Annual Maintenance Cost:** RM15,000-RM25,000 (vs RM8,000-RM12,000 for standard lorry)



      

### 3. Fuel Consumption Considerations



      

Refrigeration units increase fuel consumption:
      
• Standard lorry: 8-10 km/liter
      
• Cold chain lorry: 6-7 km/liter (20-30% higher consumption)
      
• Additional fuel cost: RM1,500-RM2,500 monthly for typical operations



      

**But:** Higher revenue from food transport easily offsets fuel costs.



      

### 4. Regulatory Compliance Requirements



      

Cold chain transport requires:
      
• Food handling certification (Ministry of Health)
      
• APAD permits for goods transport
      
• Temperature recording systems (for HACCP compliance)
      
• Regular health inspections and certifications

## Planning Your Cold Chain Lorry Acquisition



      

### Step 1: Define Temperature Requirements



      

Identify what you'll transport:
      
• Frozen foods (-18°C to -25°C): Full refrigeration unit needed
      
• Chilled foods (+2°C to +8°C): Light refrigeration sufficient
      
• Mixed loads: Multi-temperature zone lorry required



      

### Step 2: Calculate Revenue Potential



      

Research cold chain rates:
      
• Per km: RM2.50-RM4.00 (vs RM1.50-RM2.50 for standard cargo)
      
• Per trip: RM800-RM1,500 premium for temperature-controlled service
      
• Contract rates: Monthly retainer pricing common for dedicated cold chain



      

### Step 3: Determine New vs Used



      

Consider:
      
• Budget constraints
      
• Warranty importance (new units have full warranty)
      
• Technology needs (newer units have advanced temperature control)
      
• Availability (used cold chain lorries scarce compared to standard)



      

### Step 4: Get Pre-Approved Financing



      

Cold chain opportunities are time-sensitive. Get pre-approved before equipment selection to ensure rapid acquisition when contracts are awarded.



      

## The Bottom Line: Cold Chain is High-Growth, High-Margin



      

The cold chain logistics market is expanding with government support and private sector demand. Food security initiatives, e-commerce growth, and export expansion all drive demand for refrigerated transport.



      

The higher equipment cost for cold chain lorries is justified by:
      
• Premium pricing (30-50% higher rates than standard cargo)
      
• Growing market (12-15% annual growth)
      
• Limited competition (barrier to entry is equipment cost)
      
• Recurring demand (food transport is essential, not cyclical)



      

0% down payment financing makes cold chain lorry acquisition accessible without straining working capital needed for operations and compliance.
