  Learn how to get excavator financing in Malaysia. Application process, required documents, high approval rate, and tips for fast approval. 

     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     # Complete Guide to Excavator Financing in Malaysia 2025

Excavators are essential machines for construction contractors in Malaysia. New excavator prices can reach RM500,000 to RM2 million. This makes it difficult for many contractors to buy with cash.

Excavator financing helps you get the equipment you need without depleting working capital. You can pay with affordable monthly installments.

This guide will explain everything you need to know about excavator financing in Malaysia.

## Why Excavator Financing Matters for Contractors

Working capital is the lifeblood of a contractor’s business. If you spend all your money buying an excavator, you won’t have funds for:

• Paying employee salaries

• Buying raw materials

• Covering daily operating costs

• Taking on new projects

Excavator financing allows you to:

**Preserve Working Capital**
Pay only 0-30% as down payment. The remaining 70-100% is financed. Your cash remains intact for other needs.

**Get Equipment Immediately**
No need to wait years to save money. Apply today, get approval in 1-3 days, receive excavator within 2 weeks.

**Build Business Credit Record**
Consistent monthly payments help build your company’s credit record. This makes it easier to get larger financing in the future.

**Tax Benefits**
Monthly payments and interest can be deducted as business expenses. This reduces your company’s income tax.

## Types of Excavator Financing in Malaysia

### 1. Hire Purchase

Hire purchase is the most popular option for contractors in Malaysia.

**How It Works:**

• You pay a down payment (0-30%)

• Balance divided into monthly installments

• Payment period 3-9 years

• After full payment, excavator becomes yours

**Advantages:**

• Full ownership after payment complete

• Fixed monthly payments easy to plan

• Can claim tax benefits

• No usage restrictions

**Suitable For:**

• Contractors who want to own excavators

• Long-term projects

• Stable and growing companies

**Calculation Example:**

• Excavator price: RM800,000

• Down payment (20%): RM160,000

• Loan: RM640,000

• Interest rate: 4.5% per year

• Period: 7 years

• Monthly payment: RM8,950

### 2. Finance Lease

Leasing is an alternative to hire purchase. It’s more flexible for large companies.

**How It Works:**

• You rent the excavator for a certain period

• Pay monthly rent

• End of period, can buy at residual price

• Or return and lease a new one

**Advantages:**

• Lower down payment (5-10%)

• Operating costs fully deductible

• Flexibility to upgrade equipment

• No depreciation worries

**Suitable For:**

• Short-term projects (1-3 years)

• Contractors who want frequent equipment upgrades

• Companies prioritizing flexibility

### 3. Equipment Loan

Standard bank loan to buy equipment. More formal process and takes longer.

**How It Works:**

• Bank gives loan directly to you

• You buy excavator with cash

• Repay bank with interest

• Excavator becomes loan collateral

**Advantages:**

• Interest rates may be lower

• Full ownership from start

• Can choose any supplier

**Disadvantages:**

• Slow approval process (2-4 weeks)

• Stricter requirements

• More complex documentation

## Financing Benefits vs Cash Purchase

Many contractors ask: “Better to buy cash or use financing?” Here’s an honest comparison.

### Financing Benefits

**1. Preserve Working Capital**
Cash is the lifeblood of business. With financing:

• Pay only 0-30% down payment

• 70-100% balance remains in business

• Can cover daily operating costs

• Have buffer for emergencies

**2. Get Excavator Faster**
No need to wait years to save money:

• Apply today, get within 2 weeks

• Can take projects immediately

• Don’t lose tender opportunities

• Competitors get projects if you wait

**3. Build Business Credit**
Good payment record helps future:

• Easy to get larger financing

• Lower interest rates for next loans

• Banks see your company as trustworthy

• Opens opportunities for working capital loans

**4. Tax Benefits**
Monthly payments and interest are tax deductible:

• Reduce company income tax

• Excavator depreciation can be claimed

• Save thousands of ringgit every year

• Consult accountant for full benefits

**5. Financial Flexibility**
Your cash can be used for:

• Taking new projects

• Buying raw materials

• Paying salaries and overhead

• Investing in marketing

• Expanding business

### When Cash Purchase Is Better

**If You Have:**

• Excess capital not being used

• Don’t want monthly commitments

• Get big discount for cash payment

• Don’t mind reducing liquidity

**If You:**

• Large company with strong reserves

• Don’t need financing to build credit

• Want to avoid interest completely

• Have strong long-term financial plan

### Cost Comparison

**Example: RM500,000 Excavator**

**Option 1 - Cash Purchase:**

• Pay: RM500,000 today

• Working capital lost: RM500,000

• Interest: RM0

• **Total cost: RM500,000**

**Option 2 - 7-Year Financing:**

• Down payment: RM100,000 (20%)

• Pay installments: RM5,600/month × 84 months = RM470,400

• Working capital retained: RM400,000

• Total interest: RM70,400

• **Total cost: RM570,400**

**But with financing:**

• RM400,000 remains in business

• Can generate income with this money

• Interest RM70,400 tax deductible (save ~RM16,900)

• **Actual cost: RM553,500**

**Analysis:**

• Pay RM53,500 more over 7 years

• But get to use RM400,000 to generate income

• If RM400,000 gets 5% return per year × 7 years = RM140,000

• **You profit RM86,500 by using financing!**
