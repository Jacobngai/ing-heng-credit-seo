# Equipment Financing Malaysia: Complete Guide for SME Owners (2026)

Need new equipment but don't want to drain your cash? You're not alone. Most Malaysian SMEs use equipment financing to spread costs over 3-5 years while keeping working capital intact.

Here's everything you need to know.

## What Is Equipment Financing?

Equipment financing lets you buy machinery without paying cash upfront. Instead, you make monthly installments while using the equipment to grow your business.

**Common equipment financed:**
- Forklifts and material handling
- Excavators and construction machinery
- CNC machines and manufacturing equipment
- Lorries and commercial vehicles
- Restaurant and kitchen equipment

## Bank vs Private Lenders: Key Differences

| Feature | Banks | Ing Heng Credit |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Down Payment** | 20-40% required | **0% available** |
| **Approval Time** | 2-4 weeks | 48-72 hours |
| **Equipment Age** | Won't finance >10 years | **Any age accepted** |
| **Age Restrictions** | Often apply | **No age limit** |
| **Credit Requirements** | Strict | Flexible |

## How Equipment Financing Works

### Step 1: Choose Your Equipment
Select the machinery your business needs. We finance new or used equipment across all industries.

### Step 2: Get Pre-Approval
Submit basic documents:
- IC/business registration
- Bank statements (3-6 months)
- Equipment quotation

Most approvals within 48 hours.

### Step 3: Finalize Terms
We discuss:
- **Loan amount** (up to 100% of equipment value)
- **Tenure** (12-84 months typically)
- **Monthly payment** amount
- **Balloon payment** options (if desired)

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
Sign agreement → Equipment delivered → Start using immediately → Pay monthly installments.

## Benefits of 0% Down Payment

**Cash flow advantage:**
If your equipment costs RM100,000:
- **Bank way:** Pay RM30,000 upfront + monthly installments
- **Ing Heng way:** Keep your RM30,000 for operations + same monthly installments

That RM30,000 stays in your business for:
- Staff salaries
- Material purchases
- Emergency reserves
- Other growth opportunities

## Who Gets Approved?

**Good candidates:**
- Established businesses (1+ year operating)
- Consistent revenue stream
- Clear equipment need for business operations
- Reasonable debt-to-income ratio

**We also work with:**
- Startups with strong projections
- Businesses with past credit issues (case-by-case)
- Older business owners (no age limit)
- Companies upgrading old equipment

## Required Documents

**For companies:**
- SSM registration
- Director ICs
- Company bank statements (6 months)
- Latest financial statements
- Equipment quotation

**For sole proprietors:**
- IC
- Business registration
- Personal bank statements (6 months)
- Income proof

## Loan Tenure Options

| Equipment Type | Typical Tenure |
|----------------|----------------|
| Heavy machinery (excavators, bulldozers) | 60-84 months |
| Commercial vehicles (lorries, prime movers) | 48-72 months |
| Forklifts & warehouse equipment | 36-60 months |
| Manufacturing equipment | 48-72 months |
| Light equipment | 24-48 months |

Longer tenure = Lower monthly payments (but more interest total).  
Shorter tenure = Higher monthly payments (but less interest paid).

## Interest Rates & Costs

**What affects your rate:**
- Equipment type and age
- Your business profile
- Loan amount and tenure
- Down payment amount (if any)

**Typical range:** 5%-10% per annum for equipment financing.

**No hidden fees** - We're upfront about all costs before you sign.

## Tax Benefits (2026)

Equipment financing offers tax advantages:

**Capital Allowance:**
Claim depreciation on equipment. For heavy machinery, you can claim accelerated depreciation under certain conditions.

**Interest Deduction:**
Loan interest is tax-deductible as business expense.

*Consult your accountant for specifics - we provide financing documentation for tax filing.*

## Frequently Asked Questions

Yes! We finance equipment of any age. Banks typically won't finance equipment older than 10 years - we do.

We can still help. Strong business plan, director guarantees, and demonstrated need improve approval odds.

**Q: Do you require collateral beyond the equipment itself?**  
Typically, the equipment serves as collateral. Additional security depends on the case.

**Q: Can I pay off the loan early?**  
Yes, early settlement is allowed. Check your agreement for any early settlement fees (if applicable).

**Q: What happens if I miss a payment?**  
Contact us immediately. We can often restructure terms to help during temporary difficulties.

## Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Construction SME needs excavator  
**Equipment cost:** RM250,000  
**Ing Heng terms:** 0% down, 72 months

**Monthly payment:** ~RM4,200  
**Cash kept in business:** RM75,000 (vs bank 30% down payment)

That RM75,000 pays for 3 months of worker salaries, keeping the team employed while the excavator generates revenue.
