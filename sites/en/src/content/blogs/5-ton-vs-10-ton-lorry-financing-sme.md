### Diesel Price Impact Analysis



          


            With diesel at RM 3.35/litre (up 55% from June 2024), fuel efficiency becomes critical. SKDS 2.0 subsidy eligibility depends on proper documentation and fleet registration.
          



          
            

#### Monthly Fuel Cost Comparison (2,000 km/month)


            

- **5-Ton (10 km/L):** 200 liters × RM 3.35 = RM 670/month
- **10-Ton (6.5 km/L):** 308 liters × RM 3.35 = RM 1,032/month
- **Annual Difference:** RM 4,344 more fuel for 10-ton
- **Break-Even:** If 10-ton carries 2× cargo, fuel cost per kg is lower
