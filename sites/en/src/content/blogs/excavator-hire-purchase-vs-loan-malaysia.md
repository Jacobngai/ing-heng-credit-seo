## The RM500,000 Question: How Should You Finance Your Next Excavator?



      

You're a Malaysian contractor. You need an excavator. You're looking at RM500,000 for a new Caterpillar 320 or Komatsu PC200. You have two main options: **hire purchase** or **term loan**. Which saves you more money?



      

The answer isn't as straightforward as comparing interest rates. It involves tax implications, ownership structure, down payment requirements, approval speed, and your specific business situation. Let's break down both options so you can make an informed decision that saves you real RM.



      

## Option 1: Hire Purchase (Sewa Beli)



      

Hire purchase is the most common equipment financing method in Malaysia. It's straightforward: you hire the equipment with an option to purchase at the end of the term. You make fixed monthly payments, and once the final payment is made, you own the excavator outright.



      

### How Hire Purchase Works



      

1. **Select Equipment:** Choose your excavator (new or used) from any dealer
2. **Down Payment:** Pay down payment (typically 10-20%, but 0% is available)
3. **Monthly Payments:** Pay fixed monthly installments over 3-7 years
4. **Ownership:** Once final payment is made, you own the equipment



      

### Hire Purchase Advantages



      

#### 1. Tax Benefits – Capital Allowance Deductions


      

This is hire purchase's biggest advantage. Under Malaysian tax law, you can claim capital allowances on equipment financed through hire purchase:



      

- **Initial Allowance (IA):** 20% of equipment cost in Year 1
- **Annual Allowance (AA):** 20% of reducing balance each subsequent year
- **Interest Deductibility:** Hire purchase interest is fully tax-deductible as a business expense



      

**Real Savings Example:**


      

Excavator cost: RM500,000
      
Interest over 5 years: RM100,000
      
Initial Allowance (Year 1): RM100,000 deduction
      
Annual Allowance (Years 2-5): RM80,000 + RM64,000 + RM51,200 + RM40,960 deductions
      
Interest deduction: RM100,000 over 5 years
      
**Total tax deductions: RM436,160 over 5 years**



      

At 24% corporate tax rate, that's **RM104,678 in tax savings** over 5 years. That's real money back in your pocket.



      

#### 2. Fixed Monthly Payments – Cash Flow Predictability


      

Hire purchase offers fixed monthly payments for the entire tenure. You know exactly what you'll pay each month for 3-7 years. This cash flow predictability is valuable for business planning, especially in construction where project payments can be irregular.



      

**Example:** RM500,000 excavator, 5-year term, 6% p.a. interest = RM8,500/month fixed payment. You can plan project bids and operational costs around this known expense.



      

#### 3. Asset Ownership Builds Business Value


      

Unlike rental or leasing, hire purchase builds your asset base. Each payment increases your equity in the equipment. At the end of the term, you own a valuable asset outright. This matters for:


      

- CIDB grade upgrades (equipment value counts toward paid-up capital)
- Business valuation (asset-rich businesses sell for higher multiples)
- Collateral for future financing (owned equipment can secure additional loans)



      

#### 4. No Balloon Payment at the End


      

Some financing structures require a large "balloon payment" (lump sum) at the end of the term. Hire purchase doesn't—once you've made all scheduled payments, you own the equipment with no additional cost.



      

### Hire Purchase Disadvantages



      

- **Higher Interest Rates:** Typically 6-9% p.a. vs term loans at 4.5-6.5%
- **Ownership During Term:** Financing company owns equipment until final payment
- **Early Settlement Penalties:** Some agreements charge penalties for early payoff



      

## Option 2: Term Loan (Pinjaman Tempoh)



      

A term loan is a traditional bank loan where you borrow money to purchase equipment, then repay the loan with interest over time. Unlike hire purchase, you own the equipment from day one—the equipment is simply collateral for the loan.



      

### How Term Loans Work



      

1. **Apply for Loan:** Submit application with financial documents to bank
2. **Receive Funds:** Bank approves and transfers loan amount to your account
3. ** Purchase Equipment:** You buy excavator with loan funds
4. **Repay Loan:** Make monthly principal + interest payments over 3-7 years



      

### Term Loan Advantages



      

#### 1. Lower Interest Rates


      

Banks typically offer lower interest rates on term loans: 4.5% - 6.5% p.a. compared to 6% - 9% for hire purchase. On a RM500,000 excavator over 5 years, 2% difference = approximately RM25,000 in interest savings.



      

#### 2. Ownership from Day One


      

You own the equipment immediately. The bank only has a charge (lien) on the equipment as collateral. This gives you flexibility—you can sell, modify, or trade in the equipment (with bank approval).



      

#### 3. Flexible Use of Funds


      

Term loans provide cash to your account, which you use to purchase equipment. But if you negotiate a lower price or find a different deal, you can potentially use leftover funds for other business purposes (subject to bank approval).



      

### Term Loan Disadvantages



      

#### 1. Limited Tax Benefits


      

You can still claim capital allowances on equipment, but you CANNOT deduct the interest portion of your payments as a business expense (unlike hire purchase). This significantly reduces tax savings.



      

#### 2. Strict Approval Requirements


      

Banks have stringent criteria:


      

- Minimum 2-3 years in business
- Strong audited financial statements
- High credit score (CTOS/CCRIS)
- Collateral beyond equipment (property, guarantees)
- 20-30% down payment typically required



      

#### 3. Slower Approval Process


      

Bank loans typically take 2-4 weeks for approval. In construction, where projects start quickly and tenders have deadlines, this delay can mean missed opportunities.



      

#### 4. Larger Down Payment


      

Banks require 20-30% down payment. For a RM500,000 excavator, that's RM100,000 to RM150,000 upfront—capital that could be used for operations, materials, or working capital.

## Which Option Saves More RM? The Tax Factor



      

Here's where most contractors make mistakes: comparing interest rates without considering tax implications. Let's do the math:



      

### Scenario: RM500,000 Excavator, 5-Year Term



      

#### Hire Purchase at 7% p.a.


      

- Total Interest: RM87,500
- Tax Deductible Interest: RM87,500 (full amount)
- Capital Allowance Deductions: RM348,660 (IA + AA over 5 years)
- Total Tax Deductions: RM436,160
- Tax Savings at 24%: RM104,678
- **Net Cost: RM87,500 - RM104,678 = -RM17,178 (NET SAVINGS)**



      

#### Term Loan at 5% p.a.


      

- Total Interest: RM62,500
- Tax Deductible Interest: RM0 (not deductible)
- Capital Allowance Deductions: RM348,660 (same as above)
- Total Tax Deductions: RM348,660
- Tax Savings at 24%: RM83,678
- **Net Cost: RM62,500 - RM83,678 = -RM21,178 (NET SAVINGS)**



      

**Result:** Even with higher interest (7% vs 5%), hire purchase offers similar net savings due to tax-deductible interest. The difference comes down to:


      

- Down payment requirements
- Approval likelihood
- Cash flow timing



      

## The 0% Down Payment Game Changer



      

Here's what transforms the equation: **0% down payment hire purchase**. This is where hire purchase clearly beats term loans for most contractors.



      

### Cash Flow Comparison



      

**Term Loan (20% down payment):**
      
RM500,000 excavator
      
Down payment: RM100,000 (20%)
      
Loan amount: RM400,000
      
Monthly payment: RM7,800
      
**Cash tied up upfront: RM100,000**



      

**Hire Purchase (0% down payment):**
      
RM500,000 excavator
      
Down payment: RM0 (0%)
      
Financed amount: RM500,000
      
Monthly payment: RM8,500
      
**Cash tied up upfront: RM0**



      

**The RM100,000 Difference:**


      

With hire purchase at 0% down, that RM100,000 stays in your business for:
      


      

- Working capital for operations
- Materials for current projects
- CCD training for CIDB renewal
- Bidding on multiple tenders simultaneously
- Emergency fund for unexpected costs



      

**Opportunity Cost:** If RM100,000 invested in business operations generates 15% annual return, that's RM15,000 per year in additional profit—RM75,000 over 5 years. This opportunity cost often exceeds the interest rate difference between hire purchase and term loans.



      

## When Term Loan Makes Sense



      

Despite hire purchase advantages, term loans are better for certain situations:



      

### 1. Large, Established Corporations


      

If you're a G7 contractor with RM10M+ annual revenue, strong audited financials, and excellent credit, term loans offer lower interest rates. You can afford 20-30% down payment and meet strict approval criteria. The interest savings outweigh tax benefits.



      

### 2. Need for Ownership Flexibility


      

If you plan to sell or trade the excavator before the financing term ends, term loans offer more flexibility. Hire purchase agreements may have restrictions or penalties for early sale.



      

### 3. Strong Banking Relationships


      

If you have existing banking relationships and can negotiate favorable terms, term loans might offer competitive packages that rival hire purchase benefits.



      

## When Hire Purchase Is Clearly Better



      

For most Malaysian excavator contractors, hire purchase is the superior choice:



      

### 1. Small-Medium Businesses (G3-G5 Contractors)


      

You don't have RM5M+ annual revenue. Your financials might not meet bank criteria. You need flexible approval that understands contractor cash flow patterns. Hire purchase is designed for you.



      

### 2. Need Equipment Fast


      

Project starting in 2 weeks? Can't wait 4 weeks for bank approval? Hire purchase approves in 24 hours. Deploy equipment immediately. Don't miss deadlines.



      

### 3. Want to Preserve Working Capital


      

0% down payment means zero upfront cost. Keep RM100,000 in your business for operations, not tied up in equipment. Preserve cash flow for the unpredictable nature of construction.



      

### 4. Want Maximum Tax Benefits


      

Hire purchase interest is fully tax-deductible. Combined with capital allowances, the tax savings often exceed interest rate differentials.



      

### 5. Financing Used Equipment


      

Banks won't finance used equipment older than 3-5 years. Hire purchase through specialist lenders finances equipment up to 10 years old. Save 40-50% buying used while still getting financing.



      

## Why Choose Ing Heng Credit for Excavator Hire Purchase?



      

We've been providing hire purchase financing to Malaysian contractors since 1985. Here's what sets us apart:

Our signature advantage. Not 10%. Not 20%. 0% down payment. Start earning immediately with your equipment—pay from revenue, not savings.



      

### 2. Finance Used Equipment (Up to 10 Years)


      

Banks typically reject used equipment older than 3-5 years. We finance excavators up to 10 years old. A 7-year-old Komatsu PC350 at RM300,000 offers same productivity as RM600,000 new—and we approve financing for it.



      

### 3. Fast 24-Hour Approval


      

Projects don't wait. Apply today, approved tomorrow. Deploy equipment Monday for a project starting Monday. Don't lose opportunities to approval delays.



      

### 4. Small Business Friendly


      

We specialize in G3-G5 contractors. Sole proprietors, partnerships, Sdn Bhd—all welcome. We understand contractor cash flow because we've worked with it for 40+ years.



      

### 5. Finance Any Brand


      

Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi, Kobelco, Volvo, Hyundai, SANY, XCMG, Doosan, JCB—any brand. Choose equipment based on your needs, not financing restrictions.



      

### 6. Flexible Terms for Construction


      

We understand monsoon season affects revenue. We understand government projects pay Net-60+. We structure payment terms that work for real contractors, including seasonal payment options.



      

## Decision Framework: Which Option for You?



      

Use this simple decision matrix to determine the best financing option for your situation:



      

### Choose Term Loan If:


      

- ☐ Your business has RM5M+ annual revenue
- ☐ You have strong audited financial statements
- ☐ You have excellent credit (CTOS/CCRIS)
- ☐ You can afford 20-30% down payment without cash flow strain
- ☐ You can wait 2-4 weeks for approval
- ☐ You want ownership flexibility (early sale/trade-in)
- ☐ You have strong existing banking relationships



      

### Choose Hire Purchase If:


      

- ☑ You're a SME (RM100K - RM5M annual revenue)
- ☑ You need equipment fast (can't wait weeks for approval)
- ☑ You want 0% down payment to preserve working capital
- ☑ You're financing used equipment (5-10 years old)
- ☑ You want maximum tax benefits (deductible interest)
- ☑ You've been rejected by banks before
- ☑ You need flexible payment terms (seasonal options)



      

## The Bottom Line: What Saves More RM?



      

For 80% of Malaysian excavator contractors (G3-G5 grades, small-medium businesses), **hire purchase with 0% down payment saves more real money** than term loans—despite potentially higher interest rates.



      

Why?



      

1. **Tax Benefits:** Deductible interest + capital allowances = substantial tax savings
2. **Opportunity Cost:** 0% down payment preserves RM100,000 for revenue-generating operations
3. **Approval Rate:** Higher approval means you actually get the financing (vs bank rejection)
4. **Speed:** 24-hour approval means you don't miss project opportunities
5. **Used Equipment:** Finance 5-10 year old excavators at 40-50% cost savings



      

The remaining 20%—large corporations with strong financials—may benefit from term loans' lower interest rates. But for most contractors reading this, hire purchase is the smarter financial choice.
