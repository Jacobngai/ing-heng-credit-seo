  #  Business Financing for New Company Malaysia: Complete 2025 Guide 

  Get business financing for your new company in Malaysia with 0% deposit. Fast approval process and flexible terms. Learn requirements, application process, and expert tips for success. 

     By Ing Heng Credit &amp; Leasing     # Business Financing for New Company Malaysia: Complete Guide 2025

Starting a new company in Malaysia is exciting, but securing business financing can feel overwhelming. This comprehensive guide shows you exactly how new companies can get the financing they need - even with no operating history.

Whether you need equipment financing, working capital, or startup funding, you’ll discover proven strategies to get approved quickly and grow your business from day one.

## The New Company Challenge: Breaking the Catch-22

When you walk into a bank as a new company and ask for business financing, do you feel that sinking sensation in your stomach when the loan officer says, “How long have you been operating?” and your answer is “3 months”?

When you explain your business plan and they ask for 2 years of financial statements you don’t have, does that frustration build in your chest knowing your great business idea is stuck because of paperwork you literally cannot provide?

When you have a genuine contract from a customer - real revenue waiting - but you need equipment to fulfill it, and the bank says “come back after you’ve been operating for 2 years,” do you feel trapped in that impossible cycle where you need money to make money but can’t get money without already having made money?

This is the new company financing catch-22 that crushes dreams before they start.

**Here’s the truth:** Traditional banks prefer established businesses because it’s easier for them. But specialist lenders understand that every successful business was once new. Every thriving contractor, every growing logistics company, every profitable manufacturer started with zero operating history.

**The solution:** Equipment-based financing where the equipment itself provides security, making your business age less critical than your business potential.

## Why Equipment Financing Works for New Companies

### Your Equipment = Your Collateral

When you finance equipment, the lender has something tangible to secure the loan against. This changes everything for new companies:

**Traditional business loan thinking:**

• “This company has no history, high risk”

• “No financial statements to analyze”

• “How do we know they’ll pay?”

**Equipment financing thinking:**

• “This excavator is worth RM300,000”

• “If payments stop, we can recover the equipment”

• “Lower risk because of collateral”

**Real example:** Ahmad started his construction company in January 2024. Banks rejected his working capital loan because “no operating history.” But he got approved for excavator financing in 5 days because the excavator provided security. Six months later, that excavator generated enough revenue to qualify him for additional business loans.

### Types of Equipment New Companies Can Finance

**Construction Equipment:**

• Excavators (mini to large, even 10+ years old)

• Wheel loaders

• Bulldozers

• Backhoes

• Compactors

**Transportation Equipment:**

• Lorries and trucks

• Trailers

• Prime movers

• Delivery vans

**Warehouse Equipment:**

• Forklifts

• Reach stackers

• Pallet jacks

• Conveyor systems

**Manufacturing Equipment:**

• Production machinery

• Packaging equipment

• Quality control tools

• Material handling systems

**Service Equipment:**

• Specialized tools

• Cleaning equipment

• Maintenance vehicles

• Technology systems

## The 0% Deposit Advantage for New Companies

**Here’s something most new business owners don’t know:** You can get 100% financing for business equipment with 0% deposit required.

When you’re starting a new company, every ringgit matters. Traditional thinking says “save 20-30% for down payment first.” But that could take years, and opportunities don’t wait.

**Instead of waiting years to save RM60,000 for down payment:**

• Get approved with 0% deposit

• Start operations immediately

• Generate revenue from day one

• Build business credit history

• Preserve cash for working capital

**Why 0% deposit financing exists:**
Lenders understand that new companies need to preserve cash flow. By offering 100% financing, they help businesses start generating revenue faster, which actually reduces risk because the business becomes profitable sooner.

**Equipment that qualifies for 0% deposit:**

• High-value, well-maintained equipment

• Popular brands with strong resale value

• Equipment with proven income generation potential

• Applications from directors with strong personal backgrounds

## Understanding Your Financing Options

### Equipment Hire Purchase vs Leasing

**Hire Purchase (Most Popular for New Companies):**

• You own the equipment after final payment

• Monthly payments build equity

• Equipment appears on your balance sheet

• Can claim capital allowances for tax benefits

• Can sell or trade equipment if needed

**Operating Lease:**

• Lower monthly payments

• Equipment doesn’t appear on balance sheet

• Maintenance often included

• More flexibility to upgrade

• No ownership at end (return equipment)

**Which is better for new companies?**

Hire purchase typically works better because:

• Building equity from day one

• Tax benefits through capital allowances

• Asset ownership strengthens balance sheet

• Can sell equipment to raise capital if needed

### Interest Calculation Methods

**Reducing Balance (Recommended):**
Interest calculated on remaining loan balance only. As you pay principal, interest reduces each month.

**Example:** RM300,000 equipment, 8% p.a., 48 months

• Month 1 interest: RM300,000 × 8% ÷ 12 = RM2,000

• Month 24 interest: RM150,000 × 8% ÷ 12 = RM1,000

• Month 48 interest: RM50,000 × 8% ÷ 12 = RM333

**Flat Rate (Avoid if Possible):**
Interest calculated on original loan amount throughout entire term.

**Same example with flat rate:**

• Every month interest: RM300,000 × 4% ÷ 12 = RM1,000

• Total interest: RM48,000 vs RM21,000 with reducing balance

• **You pay RM27,000 more!**

Always ask: “Is this reducing balance or flat rate?” Don’t be misled by lower flat rate percentages.

## Step-by-Step Application Process for New Companies

### Phase 1: Pre-Application Preparation

**Step 1: Define Your Equipment Needs**

Be specific about what you need:

• Exact equipment type and specifications

• New vs used (up to 10+ years old equipment can be financed)

• Primary use and revenue generation plan

• Timeline urgency

**Step 2: Gather Required Documents**

**For Individual/Sole Proprietor:**

• Malaysian IC or valid work permit

• 6 months personal bank statements

• Income proof:

• Salary slips (if employed elsewhere)

• EPF statements

• Contract or job awards

• Proof of expertise/experience in the industry

**For New Companies (Sdn Bhd/Enterprise):**

• Company registration documents (Form 9/24/49)

• Directors’ IC copies

• Company bank statements (even if only 1-3 months)

• Directors’ personal bank statements (6 months)

• Company profile or business plan

• Director CVs showing relevant experience

• Any contracts, quotations, or potential customer agreements

**Step 3: Obtain Equipment Quotations**

Get official quotations from authorized dealers:

• Include brief business description

• Response within 1 hour during business hours

**Method 2: Phone Application**

• Call: +603-3362 1588

• Schedule document submission

**Method 3: Email Submission**

• Email: [info@inghengcredit.com](mailto:info@inghengcredit.com)

**Method 4: Office Visit**

### Phase 3: Credit Evaluation Process

**Day 1: Initial Review**

• Document completeness check

• Equipment valuation verification

• Request any missing documents

**Day 2-3: Detailed Analysis**

• Personal credit check (directors)

• Income verification and analysis

• Business plan evaluation

• Equipment supplier verification

• Reference checks (if provided)

**Evaluation Criteria for New Companies:**

**Personal Background of Directors (60% weight):**

• Credit history and payment behavior

• Industry experience and expertise

• Educational background

• Previous employment history

• Personal income stability

**Business Potential (25% weight):**

• Competitive advantages

• Revenue projections

• Customer contracts or interest

• Business plan quality

**Equipment and Security (15% weight):**

• Equipment type and condition

• Resale value and market demand

• Insurance requirements

• Maintenance and operational costs

### Phase 4: Approval and Terms

**Conditional Approval Options:**

Sometimes lenders approve with specific conditions:

• “Approved with higher down payment (15% instead of 0%)”

• “Approved with personal guarantee from all directors”

• “Approved pending equipment inspection”

• “Approved with additional security (property charge)”

Don’t be discouraged by conditions - they show the lender wants to work with you.

**Negotiation Opportunities:**

• Interest rate (based on down payment amount)

• Loan tenure (longer = lower monthly payment)

• Down payment amount

• Personal guarantee requirements

## Maximizing Approval Chances: Expert Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Business Substance Approach

**Show Real Business Activity:**

Even as a new company, demonstrate you’re serious:

• Register with relevant authorities (CIDB for construction, etc.)

• Open business bank account and show some activity

• Get business license and permits

• Create professional business cards and letterheads

• Develop simple website or social media presence

**Document Your Expertise:**

Directors should highlight relevant experience:

• Previous employment in the same industry

• Technical qualifications or certifications

• Training courses completed

• Professional associations membership

**Example:** Rahman worked 10 years as site supervisor before starting his construction company. He includes his employment letter, technical certificates, and reference from previous employer. This shows he has industry knowledge despite the company being new.

### Strategy 2: The Customer Validation Approach

**Get Customer Interest Before Applying:**

• Obtain quotation requests from potential customers

• Secure letters of intent (not binding contracts)

• Document market research showing demand

• Get testimonials about your personal reputation

**Example:** Siti wants to start catering equipment rental business. Before applying for commercial kitchen equipment financing, she gets letters from 5 event planners expressing interest in her services. This proves market demand exists.

### Strategy 3: The Progressive Application Approach

**Start with Smaller Equipment, Build Credit History:**

Instead of applying for RM500,000 excavator immediately:

• Start with RM150,000 mini excavator

• Make payments perfectly for 6-12 months

• Apply for additional/larger equipment

• Use good payment history as proof of reliability

**This approach works because:**

• Lower risk for first application = higher approval rate

• Established payment history for subsequent applications

• Building business credit profile

• Demonstrating business growth and success

### Strategy 4: The Alliance Approach

**Partner with Established Players:**

• Subcontracting agreements with established contractors

• Supply agreements with established suppliers

• Mentorship from industry veterans

• Joint ventures or partnerships

**Why this helps:**
Lenders see reduced risk when new companies have backing or guaranteed work from established businesses.

## Common Rejection Reasons and How to Avoid Them

### Rejection Reason 1: Insufficient Personal Income

**The Problem:** Directors don’t show enough personal income to support business loan payments.

**The Solution:**

• Include ALL income sources (salary, freelance, rental, etc.)

• Show spouse’s income if applying jointly

• Document informal income with bank deposit patterns

• Consider having higher-income partner as main applicant

### Rejection Reason 2: Poor Personal Credit History

**The Problem:** Directors have bad credit records affecting company application.

**The Solution:**

• Be upfront about credit issues (don’t hide them)

• Provide explanation letters for each negative entry

• Show recent improvement in payment behavior

• Offer higher down payment to offset risk

• Consider having clean credit director as main applicant

### Rejection Reason 3: Unrealistic Business Projections

**The Problem:** Business plan shows unrealistic revenue or profit projections.

**The Solution:**

• Use conservative, market-based projections

• Show step-by-step growth plan

• Include market research supporting assumptions

• Compare with similar business benchmarks

• Focus on cash flow, not just revenue

### Rejection Reason 4: Insufficient Equipment Understanding

**The Problem:** Applicant can’t explain how equipment will generate revenue.

**The Solution:**

• Detail specific revenue streams from equipment

• Show daily/weekly utilization plans

• Identify target customers and market rates

• Explain maintenance and operational costs

• Demonstrate industry knowledge

## Alternative Financing Options for New Companies

### Option 1: Director Personal Loan + Equipment Purchase

**How it works:**

• Director applies for personal loan

• Uses proceeds to buy equipment personally

• Rents equipment to company

• Company pays rental to director

• Director uses rental to pay personal loan

**Advantages:**

• Faster approval (personal loan vs business loan)

• No company credit history required

• Director builds personal credit

• Tax benefits through rental payments

**Disadvantages:**

• Higher interest rates (personal loan rates)

• Lower loan amounts

• Personal liability only

### Option 2: Supplier Financing Programs

**How it works:**

• Equipment suppliers offer financing directly

• Often through partnership with finance companies

• Application processed by supplier

• Equipment delivered upon approval

**Advantages:**

• Supplier relationship helps approval

• Streamlined process

• Equipment expertise from supplier

• Maintenance support included

**Examples:**

• Caterpillar Financial Services

• Komatsu Finance

• Sime Darby Motors finance programs

### Option 3: Trade-In Plus Financing

**How it works:**

• Trade existing equipment/vehicles for down payment

• Finance remaining balance

• Effective way to upgrade without cash

**Example:**

• Trade old Proton Saga (worth RM15,000)

• Plus RM35,000 cash for RM50,000 down payment

• Finance remaining RM250,000 for RM300,000 excavator

### Option 4: Progressive Purchase Plan

**How it works:**

• Start with equipment rental/lease

• Option to purchase after 6-12 months

• Rental payments count toward purchase price

• Lower initial commitment

**When this works:**

• Uncertain about equipment suitability

• Want to test market demand first

• Need immediate equipment but financing pending

• Building payment history for future applications
