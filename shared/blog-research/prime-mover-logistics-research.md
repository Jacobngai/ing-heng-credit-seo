## Haulage Henry Persona - Port Klang Focus

**Research Date:** October 11, 2025
**Target Audience:** Chinese-Malaysian hauliers, 35-55 years, Port Klang area
**Industry Focus:** Container haulage, prime mover operations, long-haul transportation

---

## Executive Summary

Port Klang has achieved a milestone by becoming the world's 10th busiest container port in 2024, handling 14.64 million TEUs (up 4.1% from 2023). This growth creates significant opportunities for hauliers, particularly Chinese-Malaysian operators looking to expand their fleets to secure shipping line contracts.

- Strong container throughput growth (9% increase in 2024)
- Government incentives for off-peak haulage operations
- Peak seasons (CNY, year-end) create high-demand periods

**Key Challenges:**
- Driver shortage of ~5,000 drivers nationwide
- Diesel price increased from RM2.15 to RM3.35/litre (June 2024)
- Port congestion during peak hours and festive seasons
- Rising detention and demurrage charges

## CONCLUSION

The container haulage industry in Malaysia, particularly around Port Klang, is at a pivotal moment in 2024-2025. The port's rise to **10th busiest globally** and **Westports' expansion to 28M TEUs by 2028** present unprecedented growth opportunities for hauliers. However, the industry also faces significant challenges: **driver shortages**, **diesel price volatility**, **port congestion**, and **regulatory compliance** requirements.

**For Chinese-Malaysian hauliers (Haulage Henry persona)**, the key to success lies in:
1. **Strategic Fleet Expansion** - Leveraging financing options to grow from 3-5 trucks to 10-15+ units
2. **Cost Management** - Maximizing SKDS 2.0 diesel subsidies and off-peak incentives
3. **Driver Retention** - Investing in better working conditions and GPS efficiency tools
4. **Peak Season Optimization** - Capitalizing on CNY and year-end shipping rushes
5. **Regulatory Compliance** - GPS tracking, APAD permits, and MOT policies
6. **Relationship Building** - Securing direct shipping line contracts through guanxi (关系)

By positioning Ing Heng as the **trusted financing partner** for Chinese-Malaysian hauliers, the company can tap into the **RM12.6 billion Westports expansion** and the broader logistics boom driven by Malaysia's **USD 6.34 billion port construction plan**.
