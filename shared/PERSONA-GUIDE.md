## Using Personas in Content Creation

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Identify Target Persona(s)

**Ask:**
1. What equipment is this content about?
2. Which persona(s) use this equipment? (See equipment mapping section)
3. Is this topic relevant to multiple personas?

**Decision:**
- If 80%+ relevant to one persona → Single persona content
- If 50/50 or 60/40 split → Create two versions
- If all three personas → Generic + specific versions

---

#### Step 2: Research Persona-Specific Keywords

**Don't assume - research!**

Even for the same equipment, personas search differently:

Example - "Forklift Financing":
- **Warehouse William searches:** "forklift financing", "forklift ROI", "forklift rental vs purchase"

"Lee运营一家3辆货车的小型物流公司。当他赢得Port Klang的长期合同时,需要立即增加2辆货车。通过2小时快速批准,他在一周内完成车队扩张,没有错过合同。现在他的车队有10辆货车。"

**Warehouse William Example (Good):**
"ABC Logistics was spending RM 36,000 per year renting forklifts. After analyzing the ROI, they financed two electric forklifts with monthly payments of RM 2,400. In 3 years, they saved RM 108,000 and owned assets worth RM 120,000."
