## Content Cluster Approach

### What Are Content Clusters?

Content clusters are groups of related content organized around a central "pillar page" topic. This approach:
- Builds topical authority
- Improves internal linking structure
- Helps search engines understand content relationships
- Provides comprehensive coverage of topics
- Boosts rankings for related keywords

### Cluster Structure

```
Pillar Page (Broad Topic)
    ├── Cluster Page 1 (Subtopic)
    ├── Cluster Page 2 (Subtopic)
    ├── Cluster Page 3 (Subtopic)
    ├── Cluster Page 4 (Subtopic)
    ├── Cluster Page 5 (Subtopic)
    └── Cluster Page 6 (Subtopic)
```

All cluster pages link to the pillar page and to each other where relevant.

### Technical Implementation for Multilingual SEO

#### Hreflang Tags

**Purpose:** Tell search engines which language version to show to users based on their location and language settings.

**Implementation:** Add hreflang tags to the `<head>` of every page with multiple language versions.

```html
<!-- On English version: /en/excavator-financing/ -->
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-MY" href="https://inghengcredit.com/en/excavator-financing/" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="zh-Hans-MY" href="https://inghengcredit.com/zh/excavator-financing/" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="ms-MY" href="https://inghengcredit.com/ms/excavator-financing/" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://inghengcredit.com/en/excavator-financing/" />
```

**Key Points:**
- Use `en-MY`, `zh-Hans-MY`, `ms-MY` (language-COUNTRY format)
- `zh-Hans` specifies Simplified Chinese (not Traditional)
- `x-default` is fallback (usually English)
- All URLs must be absolute (not relative)
- Self-referencing hreflang required

#### URL Structure

**Recommended Structure:** Subdirectories by language

```
https://inghengcredit.com/en/excavator-financing/
https://inghengcredit.com/zh/excavator-financing/
https://inghengcredit.com/ms/excavator-financing/
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear language separation
- Easy to manage
- User-friendly URLs
- Good for SEO (single domain authority)

**Alternative NOT Recommended:** Subdomains (en.inghengcredit.com)
- Splits domain authority
- More complex management
- Less user-friendly

#### Language Switcher

**Requirements:**
- Visible language switcher on all pages
- Shows all available languages
- Clear labels (English, 中文, Bahasa)
- Maintains user's page context (switching on blog post takes to same post in other language)
- Accessible on mobile (prominent placement)

#### Schema Markup for Multilingual Content

Include `inLanguage` in Article schema:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "inLanguage": "en-MY",
  "headline": "Complete Guide to Excavator Financing",
  "alternativeHeadline": "Excavator Financing Malaysia",
  ...
}
```

For other languages:
- Mandarin: `"inLanguage": "zh-Hans-MY"`
- Malay: `"inLanguage": "ms-MY"`
