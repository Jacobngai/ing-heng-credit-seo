## Notes & Special Considerations
- **Relationship-Driven:** This segment values long-term financing partnerships - potential for repeat business
- **Financial Sophistication:** These contractors have accountants and financial advisors - content must be technically accurate
- **CIDB Integration:** All content should reference CIDB classification and how equipment ownership advances contractor class
- **Project Pipeline Critical:** Approval decisions consider project backlog and tender pipeline, not just historical financials
- **Government Payment Delays:** Understand and accommodate 60-120 day payment cycles for government projects
- **Networking Events:** MBAM events, CIDB seminars, Buildtech/Archidex exhibitions are key marketing channels
- **Referral Power:** One satisfied Class A contractor can refer multiple mid-sized contractors in supply chain
- **Peak Tender Season:** Budget announcements (Oct-Nov) drive Q4 and Q1 equipment financing demand
- **Cultural Considerations:** Chinese contractors prefer discussing numbers/ROI; Malay contractors value relationships and trust-building
- **Equipment Brands:** Strong preference for Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi - mention brand financing experience
- **Used Equipment Market:** Active used equipment market - many prefer 3-5 year old equipment with proven reliability
- **Multi-Site Operations:** May need equipment in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak - consider logistics in financing discussions
