Blog Post → (User leaves or scrolls to bottom) → Related Posts → Maybe clicks
```

**Conversion Rate**: Low (5-8% of blog visitors explore further)

### After Internal Links

                ↓
        Service Link → Hire Purchase Page → Contact Form
                ↓
        Multiple conversion paths throughout article
```

**Expected Conversion Rate**: 15-20% of blog visitors (2-3x improvement)
