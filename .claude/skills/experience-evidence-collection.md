## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Construction Startup Growth

**Customer Type:** Construction company startup (first 2 years of operation)
**Location:** Selangor, Malaysia
**Business Model:** Equipment rental and contracting services

#### The Challenge

Ahmad, a construction industry veteran, was starting his own equipment rental company. He had expertise but limited business history, and his personal credit score wasn't pristine (630). Traditional banks wanted 20% down payment ($400K+) and had lengthy approval processes.

He needed $2M in equipment quickly to start operations: excavators, bulldozers, and support vehicles. Without equipment, he had no business. But without business history, getting financing seemed impossible.

#### The Solution

Our team structured a custom financing solution:
- **Equipment:** $2M (excavators, loaders, support vehicles)
- **Down Payment:** 10% ($200K from personal savings)
- **Financing:** $1.8M at 8.5% over 60 months
- **Processing:** 14 days (vs. typical 30-45 days from banks)
- **Additional Support:** Equipment valuation assistance, vendor coordination

Key to success was understanding his growth potential. Despite limited business history, his 20 years of construction experience was clear indicator of capability.

#### The Results

- **Time to Equipment:** 14 days (Ahmad started operations quickly)
- **Monthly Cash Flow:** $43K equipment payments but $85K+ rental revenue
- **Business Year 1:** 150 contracts, $720K revenue
- **Business Year 2:** 340 contracts, $1.8M revenue (150% growth)
- **Equipment Expansion:** Added $500K more equipment year 2
- **Relationship:** 2+ year customer, additional financing requests

**Customer Testimonial:**

"When I was starting my business, banks looked at my credit score and said no. Ing Heng Credit looked at my experience, understood my potential, and said yes. They made equipment financing simple and fast. Two years later, I'm running a successful business with 15 employees. They're still my financing partner."

— Ahmad Hassan, Owner, Hassan Equipment Rental

#### Why This Customer Succeeded

1. Clear value proposition (rental business with recurring revenue)
2. Experienced operator (20+ years construction experience)
3. Realistic financial projections
4. Responsive and professional throughout process
5. Committed to building long-term relationship

### Case Study 2: Logistics Fleet Expansion

**Customer Type:** Established logistics company (10+ years)
**Location:** Klang Valley, Malaysia
**Business Model:** Regional freight and logistics

#### The Challenge

Wong Logistics was thriving, but growth was constrained by cash flow. They had profitable operations but could only expand fleet slowly through internal cash generation. They needed $3M in trucks and trailers to capture new contracts, but didn't want to use banking debt that would strain working capital.

They explored leasing but typical leasing options would consume $150K/month in fixed costs. They needed flexibility and wanted to preserve cash for operations.

#### The Solution

We structured a hybrid solution:
- **Equipment Financed:** $3M (10 trucks, 15 trailers)
- **Structure:** 70% financing, 30% lease components
- **Payment:** $95K/month (vs. $150K typical lease)
- **Flexibility:** Buy-out options, seasonal adjustment options

This structure preserved $55K/month in cash flow for operations while securing growth capital.

#### The Results

- **Fleet Size:** Grew from 8 trucks to 18 trucks, 12 to 27 trailers
- **Revenue Impact:** New contracts worth $4.2M/year in incremental revenue
- **Cash Flow:** Maintained $85K+ monthly working capital reserve
- **Relationship:** 3+ years, $6M+ total financing
- **Additional Growth:** Currently in discussion for $2.5M expansion financing

**Customer Testimonial:**

"Financing is usually about choosing between growth or cash flow. Ing Heng Credit structured a solution that gave us both. The hybrid approach preserved our flexibility while enabling 200% growth. They're strategic partners, not just lenders."

— Wong Chen, Director, Wong Logistics
