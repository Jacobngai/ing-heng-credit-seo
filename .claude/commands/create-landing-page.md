### ❓ FAQ SECTION

**H2:** Frequently Asked Questions About [Equipment] Financing

**Q1: How quickly can I get approved for [equipment] financing?**
A: Most applications are approved within 24-48 hours. For straightforward cases with complete documentation, same-day approval is possible. Once approved, we can arrange payment to your equipment supplier within 1-2 business days.

**Q2: What documents do I need to apply?**
A: We keep it simple. You'll need: (1) NRIC or business registration, (2) 3-6 months bank statements, (3) Equipment quotation from supplier. For incorporated companies, we may request additional financial documents.

**Q3: Can I finance used [equipment]?**
A: Yes! We finance both new and used [equipment]. The age and condition of the equipment will affect the loan terms and interest rate. Generally, we finance used equipment up to [X] years old.

**Q4: What are the interest rates for [equipment] financing?**
A: Our interest rates start from [X]% p.a. and vary based on factors like loan amount, equipment type, loan tenure, and your business credit profile. Contact us for a personalized quote based on your specific situation.

**Q5: Do I need to provide a down payment?**
A: Down payment requirements typically range from [X]% to [Y]% of the equipment value. Lower down payments may be available for qualified applicants with strong business profiles.

**Q6: Can I pay off the loan early without penalties?**
A: [Yes/Terms may apply]. We offer flexible prepayment options. Contact us to discuss early settlement terms for your specific loan agreement.

**Q7: What if my business has irregular cash flow (seasonal work)?**
A: We understand that [industries] often have seasonal revenue patterns. We offer flexible repayment structures, including seasonal payment schedules or step-up/step-down payment plans to match your business cash flow.

**Q8: Is [equipment] financing better than leasing?**

A: Yes, we accept trade-ins. The value of your current equipment can be applied toward the down payment on your new purchase, reducing the amount you need to finance.

**Q10: What areas do you serve?**
A: We primarily serve businesses in Klang Valley (Kuala Lumpur, Selangor), Johor, and Penang. However, we consider applications from qualified businesses throughout Malaysia.

- Emphasize: Fleet expansion, cost per km, fuel efficiency
- Pain points: Upfront capital, fleet aging, logistics demands
- Benefits: Fleet package deals, quick approval for time-sensitive opportunities

**Industrial Machinery (Forklift, Manufacturing Equipment):**
- Emphasize: ROI, productivity gains, safety compliance
- Pain points: Working capital preservation, warehouse efficiency
- Benefits: Tax advantages, balance sheet optimization, immediate productivity
