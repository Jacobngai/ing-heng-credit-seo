## D/A/F Workflow System

The **Draft → Approve → Fail** system ensures human oversight:

| Folder | Purpose | Next Action |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **D/** | Draft content generated by AI | Review required |
| **A/** | Approved content ready for use | Use in production |
| **F/** | Rejected/failed content | Archive only |

**Process:**
1. AI agent generates content in `D/` folders
2. Employee reviews each file
3. Good files → Move to `A/`
4. Bad files → Move to `F/`
5. Files needing edits → Edit, then move to `A/`

## Client Onboarding Commands

### Phase 1: Draft Generation
```bash
/onboard-client [client-name]
```
Generates keyword research, personas, and brief in D/ folders.

### Phase 2: Finalization
```bash
/finalize-client [client-name]
```
Converts approved (A/) content to production setup.

## Daily Workflow Commands

### Generate Daily Content
```bash
/daily-content [client-name]
```
Creates daily blog posts/content in D/ folders for review.

### Publish Approved Content
```bash
/publish-content [client-name]
```
Publishes content from A/ folders to website.

## Image Management

All client images centralized in `/images/` with three categories:
- `/logos/` - Company logos and branding
- `/equipment-photos/` - Product/service images
- `/image-briefs/` - AI image generation prompts

**Why centralized?**
- Single source of truth for all client assets
- Prevents duplication
- Easy to locate and manage
- Shared across all content and website

## Adding a New Client

1. Create client folder: `clients/[client-name]/`
2. Run `/onboard-client [client-name]`
3. Review generated drafts in D/ folders
4. Approve good content (move to A/)
5. Run `/finalize-client [client-name]`
6. Begin daily content workflow

## Best Practices

1. **Always review D/ content** before approving (moving to A/)
2. **Keep F/ folders** for learning and iteration
3. **Document decisions** in client README.md
4. **Centralize images** in /images/ folder
5. **Archive old content** in /archive/ rather than delete

## Multilingual Support

All clients support 3 languages by default:
- **EN** - English
- **ZH** - Chinese (Mandarin/中文)
- **MS** - Malay (Bahasa Malaysia)

Content organized as:
```
/content/
├── /en/blogs/
├── /zh/blogs/
└── /ms/blogs/
```

Single website codebase serves all languages with i18n routing.

## Client Structure Benefits

1. **Consistency** - Same structure across all clients
2. **Review Workflow** - D/A/F system ensures quality
3. **Scalability** - Easy to add new clients
4. **Centralized Assets** - All images in one place
5. **Multi-language** - Built-in i18n support
6. **Automation-Friendly** - AI agents know where to put files
