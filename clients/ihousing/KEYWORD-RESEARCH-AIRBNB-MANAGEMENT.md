## 💡 KEYWORD STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Primary Keywords to Target (Create dedicated pages)

1. **Airbnb professional photography** (/services/photography/)
2. **Airbnb pricing optimization** (/services/pricing-optimization/)
3. **Airbnb setup service** (/services/setup/)
4. **Airbnb cleaning management** (/services/cleaning/)
5. **How to become an Airbnb host** (/guide/become-airbnb-host/)
