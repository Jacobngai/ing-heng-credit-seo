# Melaka Property Management Company Reviews 2025: How to Choose the Right Manager

**Choosing a property management company is like hiring a business partner. They'll handle your six-figure investment, deal with guests, and control your cash flow.**

Get it wrong, and you're stuck with:
- Poor occupancy (19-22% vs. 60%+)
- Hidden fees eating your profits
- Guest complaints damaging your reputation
- Months of notice period to exit

Get it right, and you enjoy:
- Hands-free passive income
- 60%+ occupancy rates
- Professional property care
- Peace of mind

**This guide helps you evaluate Melaka property management companies objectively, based on real data and owner experiences.**

## Why Reviews Matter (But Aren't Enough)

### The Problem with Online Reviews

**Reality Check:** Most property management "reviews" are unreliable.

**Why:**
- Companies generate fake 5-star reviews
- Negative reviews get deleted/buried
- New companies have no track record
- Old reviews may not reflect current service

**What to Look For Instead:**
- Real data (occupancy, revenue numbers)
- Transparency in pricing
- Response to issues
- Portfolio size and longevity
- Actual client testimonials (verifiable)

## What Melaka Property Owners Actually Care About

### Top 5 Decision Factors (Based on Owner Surveys)

| Factor | Importance | Why |
|--------|------------|-----|
| **Revenue Performance** | 95% | This is an investment, not a hobby |
| **Transparency** | 88% | No hidden fees, clear reporting |
| **Communication** | 82% | Know what's happening with your property |
| **Guest Reviews** | 79% | Future bookings depend on it |
| **Ease of Exit** | 65% | What if things don't work out? |

**Key Insight:** Revenue performance tops the list. A manager might be "nice" but if they can't deliver bookings, they're failing.

## Red Flags When Evaluating Property Managers

### 🚩 Red Flag #1: Vague Revenue Promises

**What They Say:**
- "We'll maximize your returns"
- "High occupancy guaranteed"
- "Market-leading rates"

**What You Should Hear:**
- "We achieve 60%+ average occupancy"
- "Our 2-bedroom Silverscape units earn RM70,000+ annually"
- "Here's actual data from similar properties"

**Ask for:**
- Specific occupancy percentages
- Actual revenue numbers from similar units
- Case studies with verifiable data
- Monthly performance reports they provide owners

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #2: Hidden Fee Structures

**Common Hidden Fees:**

| Fee Type | What Managers Charge | What It Costs You |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Commission** | 15-25% of revenue | RM10,500-17,500/year on RM70k revenue |
| **Cleaning Markup** | RM30-50 markup per stay | RM3,000-5,000/year |
| **Maintenance Markup** | 10-20% on contractor cost | RM500-2,000/year |
| **Platform Fees** | Charged to YOU | RM3,000-6,000/year |
| **"Administrative" Fee** | RM50-100/month | RM600-1,200/year |

**Total Hidden Cost:** RM17,600-31,700/year ABOVE quoted commission

**Transparent Managers (Like iHousing):**
- All costs disclosed upfront
- No markup on cleaning (in-house team)
- No markup on maintenance
- Platform fees clearly separated
- One flat management fee - that's it

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #3: Long Contract Lock-Ins

**What to Watch For:**
- 12-month minimum contracts (standard)
- **24+ month contracts** (avoid)
- **Automatic renewal** clauses (dangerous)
- **Early termination penalties** (run!)

**iHousing Policy:**
- 12-month standard contract
- No automatic renewal
- 30-day notice to terminate
- No penalty clauses for underperformance

**Why This Matters:**
If a manager underperforms, you shouldn't be trapped for 2+ years.

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #4: Poor Response Times

**Test Before Signing:**

**Do This:**
- WhatsApp them with a question
- Note response time
- Ask to speak to an existing owner
- Request a property visit

**Good Response:**
- Reply within 2 hours during business
- Answer all questions clearly
- Happy to provide owner references
- Accommodate property visit

**Red Flag:**
- Reply takes 24+ hours
- Vague answers
- Refuses owner references ("privacy")
- Won't show actual properties

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #5: Small or Non-Existent Portfolio

**Ask:**
- "How many properties do you manage?"
- "How long have you been operating?"
- "Which condos do you have units in?"

**Green Flags:**
- 50+ properties
- 3+ years in Melaka market
- Multiple condos across Melaka
- Can show actual listings

**Red Flags:**
- "We're launching soon" (unproven)
- 5-10 properties (too small to be efficient)
- 1-2 years experience (may not survive)
- Only 1-2 condos (limited reach)

**iHousing Stats:**
- 100+ properties managed
- 8 years in Melaka market
- 10 condos across Melaka
- 5-platform distribution
