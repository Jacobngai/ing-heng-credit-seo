## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I know the cleaning was done properly?
**A:** Every cleaning is photographed and checklist-completed. We also message guests to confirm cleanliness. Any issues are resolved within 1 hour, free.

### Q: What if the cleaner damages something?
**A:** We cover it. Our team is trained and careful, but accidents happen. We repair or replace anything our team damages - no questions asked.

### Q: Do I need to provide cleaning supplies?
**A:** No. We bring everything. Your condo stays stocked with our supplies, replenished as needed.

### Q: Can I use my own linen?
**A:** You can, but why? We provide premium hotel-quality linens, laundered professionally. Your personal linens would need storage and would increase your costs.

### Q: What if a guest requests extra cleaning during their stay?
**A:** Included (within reason). Daily housekeeping isn't standard, but if guests need fresh towels or a quick tidy, we accommodate. Extensive cleaning during stays may incur small extra fee.

### Q: How do you handle same-day turnovers?
**A:** Easily. Our team is scheduled based on checkout times, so we're there right after guests leave. 3 PM check-ins guaranteed, often earlier.
