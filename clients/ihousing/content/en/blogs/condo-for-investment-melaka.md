## Key Factors When Choosing Your Investment Condo

### 1. Building Rules and Strata Compliance

**CRITICAL:** Before buying, verify:
- ✅ Short-term rental is allowed (check strata title)
- ✅ No restrictions on guest frequency
- ✅ Parking allocation for guests
- ✅ Guest registration process is manageable

**Red flags:**
- Strata titles explicitly prohibiting short-term rentals
- Buildings with strict owner-only occupancy clauses
- Limited parking (1 bay per unit is minimum)

### 2. Unit Selection Within the Building

Not all units in the same building perform equally:

**Premium Units Command 15-25% More:**
- Higher floors with better views
- Corner units with more windows
- Units away from elevators and noise
- Units with balconies (where available)

**Avoid:**
- Ground floor units (privacy and noise issues)
- Units adjacent to facilities (pool, gym - noise)
- Units with blocked or undesirable views

### 3. Furnishing Requirements by Condo Type

| Condo Type | Furnishing Budget | Style Expectation |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Beachfront | RM25,000-40,000 | Resort-style, modern tropical |
| City Centre | RM20,000-35,000 | Urban chic, practical |
| Budget Condo | RM15,000-25,000 | Clean, functional, minimalist |

**Beachfront guests expect:** Higher finish levels, resort aesthetics
**City centre guests expect:** Convenience, cleanliness, comfort

### 4. Management Considerations

Some condos are easier to manage than others:

**Easier Management:**
- 24-hour security (smooth guest handovers)
- On-site parking (no coordination issues)
- Digital lock compatibility (strata permitting)
- Responsive building management

**More Challenging:**
- Manual key handover systems
- Strict guest registration processes
- Limited visitor parking
- Unresponsive building management

## Questions to Ask Before Buying

### 1. "Is Airbnb/short-term rental explicitly allowed?"

Don't assume. Get this in writing from the building management.

### 2. "What's the actual occupancy rate in this building?"

Ask for data from hosts currently operating in the building, not just agent projections.

### 3. "What's the typical furnishing cost for this building type?"

Budget realistically. Under-furnished units get poor reviews.

### 4. "How does guest check-in work?"

Digital locks vs key handover makes a huge operational difference.

### 5. "What management services are available?"

Not all areas have professional management options. DIY might be your only choice.
