# 7 Signs Your Airbnb Manager Is Failing (And What to Do About It)

## You Hired a Manager to Make Your Life Easier. But Are They Actually Costing You Money?

You thought hiring a professional Airbnb management company would mean:
- Consistent monthly income
- Zero headaches with guests
- Professional handling of cleaning and maintenance
- Better occupancy than you could achieve yourself

But 6 months later, you're noticing:
- Occupancy rates that are lower than expected
- Payments that arrive late (or not at all)
- Guest complaints in your reviews
- Vague explanations when you ask questions

**You're not imagining it.** Many Melaka property owners discover too late that their Airbnb manager is underperforming. The difference between a great manager and a failing one can mean **RM5,000-15,000+ in lost annual revenue**.

This article will help you identify the warning signs early, understand what's really happening with your property, and show you exactly how to switch to a better manager without losing bookings or income.

## Sign #1: Your Occupancy Rate Is Below Market Average

### What You Should Be Earning

Based on 2024-2025 Melaka market data:

| Property Type | Market Occupancy | Your Manager Should Target |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Studio (Jonker Street area) | 22-28% | 25%+ |
| 2-Bedroom (Bandar Hilir) | 20-26% | 23%+ |
| 3-Bedroom (Heritage zone) | 18-24% | 21%+ |

**Red Flag:** If your occupancy is consistently below 15%, something is wrong.

### Why Low Occupancy Happens

A failing manager typically has these issues:

**1. Poor Listing Optimization**
- Low-quality or outdated photos
- Weak description that doesn't sell your property
- Missing key amenities in listing
- Not updating seasonal pricing

**Impact:** Your listing gets buried on page 3-4 of search results. Guests never see it.

**Example:** A Silverscape Residence owner was getting 12% occupancy. When we took over, we discovered:
- Photos were 3 years old (showed worn furniture)
- Description didn't mention key selling points (UNESCO view, pool access)
- Price was static (RM180/night even during CNY peak)

**Result:** After new photography, optimized description, and dynamic pricing, occupancy jumped to 28%.

**2. Single-Platform Listing**

Many managers list ONLY on Airbnb. This is leaving money on the table:

| Platform | % of Our Bookings |
|----------|-------------------|
| Airbnb | 45% |
| Booking.com | 25% |
| Agoda | 15% |
| VRBO | 8% |
| Expedia | 7% |

**Red Flag:** Ask your manager which platforms they use. If it's just Airbnb, you're missing 40-50% of potential bookings.

**3. Slow Response Time**

Airbnb's algorithm penalizes hosts who respond slowly:
- **Under 1 hour:** Best ranking
- **1-3 hours:** Average ranking
- **3+ hours:** Poor ranking (your listing gets buried)

**Test it:** Create a fake guest inquiry and time how long they take to respond. If it's over 1 hour during business hours, that's a problem.

---

## Sign #2: You're Not Receiving Detailed Monthly Reports

### What a Good Report Looks Like

Every month, you should receive a report that includes:

| Report Section | What It Tells You |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Booking Summary** | Every booking with guest name, dates, platform, revenue |
| **Occupancy Rate** | Your % vs. market average |
| **Income Statement** | Gross revenue, all deductions, net amount |
| **Expense Breakdown** | Cleaning, supplies, repairs with actual costs |
| **Guest Reviews** | Summary of feedback (positive AND negative) |
| **Platform Performance** | Which platform is performing best |
| **Pricing Analysis** | How your rates compare to competitors |
| **Next Month's Forecast** | Confirmed bookings + projected occupancy |

**Red Flag:** If your "report" is just a bank transfer with a one-line message like "Here's your income for the month," that's unacceptable.

### Why Poor Reporting Matters

Without detailed reports, you can't:
- **Track performance** - Is your property improving or declining?
- **Spot problems** - Are cleaning costs suddenly spiking?
- **Optimize pricing** - Are you underpriced during peak seasons?
- **Plan ahead** - Do you have low occupancy next month you need to fix?

**Real example:** A Shore Residence owner noticed her income dropped 30% but her manager said "everything's fine, it's just low season." When she switched to us, our first report revealed:
- Her manager had raised prices too high (losing price-sensitive guests)
- She had zero bookings on Booking.com (her manager wasn't listed there)
- 3 recent negative reviews mentioned "slow check-in" (her manager had no backup staff)

**Result:** We fixed pricing, added her to 4 more platforms, and implemented key handoff service. Income increased 45%.

## Sign #3: Guest Reviews Are Declining (Or Non-Existent)

### The Review Trap

Airbnb reviews are your most valuable asset:
- **4.8+ stars:** Superhost status, higher search ranking
- **4.5-4.7 stars:** Average performance
- **Below 4.5 stars:** Algorithm penalizes your listing
- **Under 4.0 stars:** Guests won't book

**Red Flag:** If your rating has dropped from 4.8 to 4.5, your manager is failing.

### Common Review Issues That Indicate Manager Problems

**Issue #1: "Communication Was Slow"**
- *Review example:* "Host took 6 hours to respond to questions. Had to call multiple times."
- **Manager's fault:** No 24/7 response system
- **Impact:** 1-star deduction on communication, overall rating drops

**Issue #2: "Place Wasn't Clean"**
- *Review example:* "Found dust on shelves, bathroom wasn't properly cleaned."
- **Manager's fault:** Poor cleaning quality control (or outsourced to cheapest option)
- **Impact:** Devastating for future bookings

**Issue #3: "Check-In Was Confusing"**
- *Review example:* "Couldn't find the place, host didn't provide clear directions."
- **Manager's fault:** No proper guest communication system
- **Impact:** First impression ruined, affects entire stay

**Issue #4: "Basic Amenities Missing"**
- *Review example:* "No toilet paper when we arrived. Had to buy our own."
- **Manager's fault:** Poor inventory management
- **Impact:** Unprofessional, reflects poorly on you as owner

### How a Good Manager Prevents Bad Reviews

**24/7 Guest Communication**
- We respond within 30 minutes, 24/7
- Multi-language support (English, Malay, Chinese)
- Proactive messaging (check-in instructions sent 24 hours before arrival)

**Quality Cleaning Standards**
- In-house cleaning team (not outsourced)
- Checklist system (60+ items checked after every stay)
- Random inspections by manager

**Professional Check-In Process**
- Personal greeting whenever possible
- Clear photo and video instructions for self-check-in
- Backup key access if guest arrives late

**Amenity Management**
- Bulk supplies always stocked
- Automatic replacement when low
- Seasonal additions (extra towels during beach season, etc.)

## Sign #4: Your Income Has Dropped Without Explanation

### The Gradual Decline Trap

This is the most dangerous sign because it happens slowly:

| Month | Your Income | Manager's Excuse |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| January | RM2,500 | - |
| February | RM2,300 | "It's low season after CNY" |
| March | RM2,100 | "Still slow, tourism is down" |
| April | RM1,900 | "Just a quiet month" |
| May | RM1,700 | "Market is soft overall" |

**Reality:** While your income dropped 32%, the market didn't. Your manager's performance declined.

### What's Actually Happening (Behind the Excuses)

**1. They're Not Adjusting Pricing Dynamically**

Good managers adjust prices daily based on:
- Demand (weekends, holidays, events)
- Competition (what similar units are charging)
- Seasonality (school holidays, peak tourist periods)
- Lead time (last-minute discounts vs. early-bird rates)

**Failing manager approach:** Set a price and forget it. 6 months later, it's still RM180/night regardless of demand.

**Real impact:** A unit at Melaka Raya could earn:
- Fixed pricing (RM180/night): RM5,400/year at 15% occupancy
- Dynamic pricing: RM9,000/year at 22% occupancy

**That's RM3,600 more per year - just from better pricing.**

**2. They've Stopped Marketing Your Property**

When a manager takes on too many properties, yours gets neglected:
- No new photos added
- Description never updated
- Not responding to platform optimization suggestions
- Not refreshing listing periodically

**Impact:** Your listing becomes "stale" in the algorithm, ranking drops.

**3. They're Prioritizing Other Properties**

If your manager manages properties across KL, Penang, and Melaka, they may prioritize:
- Higher-revenue properties (luxury villas)
- Easier-to-manage properties (closer to their office)
- Properties owned by their "favorite" clients

**Your property gets the leftover attention.**

## Sign #5: Maintenance Issues Are Taking Too Long to Resolve

### The Maintenance Cascade Effect

A small maintenance issue becomes a big problem:

**Day 1:** Guest reports AC not cooling properly
**Day 2:** You tell your manager
**Day 5:** Still no update, you follow up
**Day 10:** Manager says "technician coming tomorrow"
**Day 15:** Technician finally arrives
**Day 16:** Guest leaves 2-star review: "AC was broken entire stay"

**Result:**
- RM500 refund to guest (partially)
- 2-star review visible for 12 months
- Future guests see review and don't book
- Occupancy drops 10-15%
- You lose RM1,200-1,800/year in revenue

**All because a 3-day repair took 15 days.**

### Why Failing Managers Are Slow on Maintenance

**1. They Don't Have Trusted Contractors**

They search for contractors on Facebook Marketplace when issues arise (instead of having reliable contacts ready).

**Impact:**
- Days wasted finding someone
- Higher prices (emergency rates)
- Poor quality work (wrong person for the job)

**2. They're Avoiding the Cost**

Some managers delay repairs to avoid spending your money (not wanting to "bother" you with small expenses).

**Reality:** RM300 repair today vs. RM3,000 damage later.

**3. No Systems for Tracking Issues**

Without proper tracking:
- Issues get forgotten
- No follow-up on guest complaints
- Recurring problems never permanently fixed

**Good manager approach:**
- Online ticketing system for all issues
- Automatic escalation if not resolved in 48 hours
- Photo documentation for all repairs
- Preventive maintenance schedule

## Sign #6: You're Paying Hidden Fees You Didn't Agree To

### The Hidden Fee Trap

You agreed to 20% commission. But your statements show:

| Fee | Amount | Explanation |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Commission | RM500 | 20% agreed |
| Cleaning markup | RM150 | "Service fee" (not discussed) |
| Emergency call fee | RM75 | "After-hours support" |
| Supply surcharge | RM50 | "Convenience fee" |
| Platform listing fee | RM100 | "Listing maintenance" |
| **Total deductions** | **RM875** | **35% effective commission** |

**Red Flag:** Any fee not in your original contract.

### Common Hidden Fees to Watch For

**1. Cleaning Markup**
- Actual cleaning cost: RM80
- Manager charges you: RM120
- Hidden markup: RM50 (62% markup!)

**2. "Emergency" Call Fees**
- Guest calls at 9 PM with locked door
- Manager charges RM50 "after-hours fee"
- This happens 5-10 times per month
- Annual cost: RM250-500 you weren't expecting

**3. Maintenance Margin**
- Plumber charges RM300
- Manager bills you RM360
- "Coordination fee" you never approved

**4. Supply Surcharges**
- Toilet paper, soap, linens
- Manager buys at retail, charges you +25%
- Or buys bulk but keeps the savings

**5. Platform Listing Fees**
- Some managers charge extra for listing on multiple platforms
- Should be INCLUDED in base management fee

### How to Spot Hidden Fees

**Request a line-by-line breakdown of ALL deductions, including:**
- Exact cleaning cost (with vendor name)
- All maintenance with contractor invoices attached
- Supply purchases with receipts
- Any "service fees" with explanation

**If manager refuses or delays:** That's a major red flag.

## Sign #7: You Feel Like You're Still Managing Everything Yourself

### The "Self-Service" Manager

You hired a manager to free up your time. But you're still:
- Fielding guest calls at night
- Arranging your own repairs
- Buying supplies for the condo
- Dealing with building management
- Updating calendars manually

**You're paying 20% commission for... what exactly?**

### What a Manager SHOULD Handle (So You Don't Have To)

**Guest-Related Tasks:**
- Responding to all guest inquiries
- Sending check-in instructions
- Greeting guests (when possible)
- Handling complaints and issues during stays
- Processing check-outs
- Managing reviews

**Operational Tasks:**
- Scheduling cleaning after every stay
- Inspecting cleaning quality
- Reordering supplies
- Coordinating repairs and maintenance
- Paying bills on your behalf
- Dealing with condo management

**Marketing Tasks:**
- Optimizing listings on all platforms
- Updating photos seasonally
- Adjusting pricing daily
- Responding to platform recommendations
- Monitoring competitor pricing
- Running promotions during low periods

**Reporting Tasks:**
- Monthly income statements
- Occupancy analysis
- Market comparisons
- Guest review summaries
- Improvement recommendations

**If you're doing ANY of these yourself, your manager is failing.**
