## Common Mistakes Melaka Investors Make

### Mistake #1: Buying Wrong Property

**Bad Investments:**
- Condos with strata rules prohibiting short-term rental
- Units too far from attractions (guests won't book)
- "Fixer-uppers" requiring excessive renovation
- Studios (limited market, low rates)

**Smart Investments:**
- Verify strata allows Airbnb BEFORE buying
- Within 15 minutes of Jonker Street/heritage area
- Move-in ready or light renovation only
- 1-3 bedroom units (best ROI)

---

### Mistake #2: Under-Furnishing

**Budget Setup Backfires:**
- Cheap furniture = poor reviews
- Poor reviews = lower occupancy
- Lower occupancy = lost revenue

**Reality:**
- RM20,000 furnishing = 3-star reviews = RM40,000 revenue
- RM35,000 furnishing = 5-star reviews = RM70,000 revenue

**ROI:** Better furnishing pays for itself in 6-12 months.

---

### Mistake #3: Self-Managing

**The Reality:**
- Self-managed occupancy: 19-22%
- Professional occupancy: 35-38%

**Cost of Self-Management:**
- Lost revenue: RM25,000-35,000/year
- Time investment: 10-15 hours/week
- Stress: High (guests at all hours)
- Risk: Burnout, exit market

**Better:** Professional management = higher net income, zero stress.

---

### Mistake #4: Wrong Pricing Strategy

**Fixed Pricing Problem:**
- Charge RM200 every night
- Empty midweek (could charge RM120 and get bookings)
- Leaving money on table weekends (could charge RM260)

**Dynamic Pricing Solution:**
- Low season weekday: RM130-150
- Low season weekend: RM180-210
- High season weekday: RM180-210
- High season weekend: RM230-280

**Result:** +25-35% revenue vs. fixed pricing

---

### Mistake #5: Single-Platform Listing

**Airbnb-Only Problem:**
- Only 45% of market share
- Miss Booking.com guests (25%)
- Miss Agoda guests (15%)
- Miss VRBO/Expedia guests (15%)

**Multi-Platform Solution:**
- List on 5 platforms
- Sync calendars automatically
- 60% more bookings
