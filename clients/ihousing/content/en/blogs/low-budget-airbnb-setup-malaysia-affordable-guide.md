# Low Budget Airbnb Setup Malaysia: Complete Affordable Startup Guide 2025

**Think you need RM50,000+ to start an Airbnb? Think again.**

Many first-time hosts overspend, buying things guests don't care about. The truth is, you can furnish a functional, attractive Airbnb for RM15,000-20,000 and still get 5-star reviews.

**The secret?** Spend on what matters (bed, WiFi, photos), save on what doesn't (brand names, fancy decor).

We've set up 100+ properties across all budget levels. This guide shows you exactly how to start Airbnb on a budget without sacrificing guest satisfaction.
