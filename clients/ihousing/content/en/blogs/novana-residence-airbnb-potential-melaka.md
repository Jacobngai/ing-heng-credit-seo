## Novana Management FAQs

**Q: Why is custom pricing necessary for Novana?**
A: Novana units vary significantly in size, view, furnishing, and configuration. A 1-bedroom city view unit requires different management than a 3-bedroom heritage view unit. Custom pricing ensures you only pay for the services your specific unit needs.

**Q: How does custom pricing compare to flat fees?**
A: For smaller or simpler units, custom pricing may be similar to flat fees. For larger or more complex units, fees are higher but so is income potential. We structure fees to align with your revenue and provide clear ROI.

**Q: Can I use my Novana unit personally?**
A: Absolutely. We simply block your personal dates in our shared calendar. Most owners use their units 2-4 weeks yearly without significantly impacting income. We recommend blocking dates in advance to avoid disrupting bookings.

A: Novana Residence allows short-term rentals. We ensure full compliance with:
