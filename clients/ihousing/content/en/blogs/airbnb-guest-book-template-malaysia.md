# Airbnb Guest Book Template Malaysia: Complete Welcome Guide for Hosts

**A professional guest book can mean the difference between a 4-star and 5-star review.**

Think about it: Your guests arrive tired, possibly lost, carrying luggage. They don't want to message you with basic questions. They want answers NOW.

A well-designed guest book provides those answers instantly. It reduces your messages by 70%, prevents problems, and creates a polished, professional impression.

**Bonus:** We provide complete guest books for all the properties we manage. You never have to create one yourself.

But if you're self-managing (or want to upgrade your current setup), this guide has everything you need.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Information Overload

**Don't:** Write 20 pages of text
**Do:** Keep it concise and scannable

Guests don't read novels. They want quick answers.

### Mistake #2: Vague Instructions

**Don't:** "The AC is in the living room"
**Do:** "AC remote is on the coffee table. Point at living room AC unit and press 'On' button"

Be specific. Imagine you've never been there before.

### Mistake #3: No Visuals

**Don't:** Text-only instructions
**Do:** Include photos of:
- Key card access points
- Switch locations
- Remote controls
- Trash chute location
- Parking area

A picture is worth 1000 messages.

### Mistake #4: Outdated Information

**Don't:** Old WiFi password, changed restaurant hours
**Do:** Review and update every 3 months

### Mistake #5: Too Friendly OR Too Formal

**Don't:** Super casual OR extremely corporate
**Do:** Professional but warm

Balance professionalism with hospitality.
