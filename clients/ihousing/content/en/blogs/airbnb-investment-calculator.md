| Item | Budget | Premium |
|------|--------|---------|
| Property purchase | RM250,000 | RM600,000+ |

---

### Step 2: Revenue Projection

**Your revenue depends on three factors:**
1. Nightly rate (location, quality, amenities)
2. Occupancy rate (management quality, demand)
3. Nights per month (maximum is 30)

#### Nightly Rate Calculation

**Base Rates by Property Type (Melaka):**

| Property Type | Base Rate | Weekend Rate | Holiday Rate |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Studio | RM80-100 | RM110-130 | RM130-180 |
| 1-Bedroom | RM100-130 | RM130-170 | RM160-220 |
| 2-Bedroom (Standard) | RM120-150 | RM160-200 | RM190-280 |
| 2-Bedroom (Premium) | RM160-200 | RM200-260 | RM250-350 |
| 3-Bedroom | RM180-240 | RM240-320 | RM300-450 |

#### Occupancy Rate Calculation

**Realistic Occupancy (Well-Managed):**

| Location/Month | Weekday | Weekend | Overall Monthly |
|----------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Beachfront (Peak) | 40-50% | 85-95% | 65-75% |
| Beachfront (Off-Peak) | 25-35% | 60-70% | 45-55% |
| City Centre (Standard) | 45-55% | 75-85% | 60-70% |
| City Centre (Peak) | 50-60% | 80-90% | 65-75% |

**Annual Average:** 60-75% for well-managed properties

#### Monthly Revenue Formula

```
Monthly Revenue = (Base Rate × Weekday Nights × Weekday Occupancy) + (Weekend Rate × Weekend Nights × Weekend Occupancy)
```

**Example: 2-Bedroom Standard Condo**
- Base rate: RM140
- Weekend rate: RM180
- Weekday nights: 22 nights
- Weekend nights: 8 nights
- Weekday occupancy: 45%
- Weekend occupancy: 80%

**Calculation:**
- Weekday revenue: RM140 × 22 × 0.45 = RM1,386
- Weekend revenue: RM180 × 8 × 0.80 = RM1,152
- **Total monthly revenue: RM2,538**

---

### Step 3: Monthly Operating Expenses

**Fixed Expenses (Every Month):**

| Expense | Budget Range | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Strata / Assessment | RM150-250 | Fixed by building |
| Internet | RM60-100 | Essential for guests |
| Insurance | RM50-100 | Property protection |
| **Fixed Total** | **RM260-450** | |

**Variable Expenses (Usage-Dependent):**

| Expense | Budget Range | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Electricity | RM100-250 | Higher with AC usage |
| Water | RM20-50 | Minimal impact |
| Maintenance fund | RM100-200 | Repairs & replacements |
| Supplies replenishment | RM50-150 | Consumables |
| **Variable Total** | **RM270-650** | Depends on occupancy |

**Platform Fees:**
- Airbnb: 3% of revenue (host side)
- Booking.com: 15% commission + 3% host fee
- **Average: 8-12% of revenue**

**Management Fee (if hiring):**
- iHousing (Parkland): RM200-300/month flat
- iHousing (other condos): Custom pricing
- Industry typical: 15-25% of revenue

**Total Monthly Expenses:**

| Management Type | Low Range | High Range |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Self-Managed | RM530-1,100 | RM900-1,700 |
| iHousing Flat Fee | RM730-1,200 | RM1,200-2,000 |
| Industry Commission | RM900-1,900 | RM1,600-3,100 |

---

### Step 4: Net Income Calculation

**Monthly Net Income = Monthly Revenue - Monthly Expenses**

**Example (2-Bedroom Standard Condo):**
- Monthly revenue: RM3,500 (well-managed)
- Monthly expenses:
  - Fixed: RM350
  - Variable: RM450
  - Platform fees (10%): RM350
  - Management (iHousing): RM250
  - **Total: RM1,400**
- **Monthly net: RM2,100**
- **Annual net: RM25,200**

---

### Step 5: ROI Calculation

**Cash-on-Cash Return:**

```
Annual Net Income / Total Cash Invested × 100 = Cash-on-Cash ROI %
```

**Example:**
- Total cash invested: RM350,000
- Annual net income: RM25,200
- ROI = RM25,200 / RM350,000 × 100 = **7.2%**

**Gross Rental Yield:**

```
Annual Revenue / Property Value × 100 = Gross Rental Yield
```

**Example:**
- Annual revenue: RM42,000
- Property value: RM350,000
- Gross yield = RM42,000 / RM350,000 × 100 = **12%**

## What Impacts Your ROI?

### Positive Factors (Increase ROI):

✅ **Professional Management:** 24/7 response + dynamic pricing
✅ **Multi-Platform Listing:** Airbnb + Booking.com + others
✅ **Excellent Reviews:** 5-star ratings justify premium rates
✅ **Smart Pricing:** Dynamic rates based on demand

### Negative Factors (Decrease ROI):

❌ **Poor Location:** No tourist appeal or accessibility issues
❌ **Under-Furnishing:** Cheap furniture shows in photos/reviews
❌ **Self-Management:** Lower occupancy and rates typically
❌ **Single Platform:** Only on Airbnb limits bookings
❌ **Bad Reviews:** Even a few 3-star reviews hurt significantly
❌ **Fixed Pricing:** Missing out on peak demand surges

## The Management Impact on ROI

Here's what most calculators ignore: **Professional management typically INCREASES net income despite the fee.**

### Self-Managed vs Professionally Managed ROI

**Self-Managed Property:**
- Occupancy: 55-65% (no 24/7 response)
- Revenue: RM3,000/month
- Management fee: RM0
- **Net: RM2,400/month**
- **Annual: RM28,800**
- **ROI: 8.2%**

**Professionally Managed (iHousing):**
- Occupancy: 65-75% (24/7 response)
- Revenue: RM4,200/month (+40%)
- Management fee: RM250/month
- **Net: RM3,050/month (+27%)**
- **Annual: RM36,600 (+27%)**
- **ROI: 10.5% (+28%)**

**The verdict:** Paying RM250/month to earn RM7,800 more annually is a no-brainer.

---

## Long-Term Appreciation Considerations

Your ROI isn't just cash flow. Property appreciation adds to total returns.

**Historical appreciation in tourist areas:** 3-5% annually

**Total Return Example:**
- Cash flow ROI: 10%
- Appreciation: 4%
- **Total return: 14% annually**
