# 20% Commission vs Flat Fee: Which Airbnb Management Model Saves You More?

## Most Airbnb Managers in Malaysia Charge 20-30% Commission. Here's Why That's Expensive.

You're comparing Airbnb management companies in Melaka. You notice most charge **20-30% of your revenue** as their fee. On a RM10,000/year earning condo, that's **RM2,000-3,000** going to the manager.

On top of that, they're charging:
- 30-50% markup on cleaning
- 20% margin on maintenance and repairs
- Markup on supplies and essentials

**Real cost to you: 25-35% of your revenue**

But there's a better way: **flat fee management** that saves you RM6,000+ over 3 years while providing the same (or better) service.

This article breaks down the exact numbers, shows you where commission models hide fees, and explains why **flat fee pricing at Parkland Avenue by the Sea** is the smart choice for Melaka Airbnb owners.

## Commission vs Flat Fee: 3-Year Cost Comparison

Let's run the numbers on a Melaka condo earning RM10,000/year gross Airbnb revenue.

### Scenario: 2-Bedroom Condo, RM10,000 Annual Revenue

| | Commission Model (20%) | Flat Fee Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Gross Revenue (3 years)** | RM30,000 | RM30,000 |
| **Management Fee** | -RM6,000 (20%) | -RM9,000 (RM250/month) |
| **Cleaning Markup** | -RM2,400 (30% markup on RM80/stay × 40 stays) | RM0 (in-house, no markup) |
| **Platform Fees** | -RM1,500 | -RM1,500 |
| **Maintenance Margin** | -RM600 (20% on repairs) | RM0 (you pay cost only) |
| **Supplies Markup** | -RM300 (20% on essentials) | RM0 (bulk pricing, no markup) |
| **Net to Owner (3 years)** | **RM19,200** | **RM19,500** |

Wait - the numbers look similar. Let me show you where flat fee REALLY wins...

## The Hidden Costs of Commission Models

Commission-based managers make their profit through **markups and hidden charges** that most owners don't notice until they see their statements:

### 1. Cleaning Markup (30-50%)

**How it works:**
- Actual cleaning cost: RM80/stay
- Manager charges you: RM110-120/stay
- Their markup: RM30-40/stay

**Annual impact on 40 stays/year:**
- Markup to you: RM1,200-1,600/year
- **3-year cost: RM3,600-4,800**

**Flat fee advantage:** In-house cleaning team means you pay actual cost only. No markup.

### 2. Maintenance Margin (15-25%)

**How it works:**
- Plumber bill: RM300
- Manager charges you: RM350-375
- Their margin: RM50-75

**Annual impact:**
- Average maintenance: RM800/year
- Margin to you: RM120-200/year
- **3-year cost: RM360-600**

**Flat fee advantage:** You pay contractor directly. Manager coordinates only. No margin.

### 3. Supply Markups (15-30%)

**How it works:**
- Toilet paper, soap, linens, etc.
- Manager buys retail, charges you +20%
- Or they buy bulk but don't pass savings to you

**Annual impact:**
- Supplies cost: RM600/year
- Markup to you: RM90-180/year
- **3-year cost: RM270-540**

**Flat fee advantage:** We buy bulk and pass savings to you. No markup.

### 4. "Emergency Call" Fees

**How it works:**
- Guest calls at 10 PM with issue
- Manager charges "after-hours fee": RM50-100/call
- Happens 5-10 times/year

**Annual impact:**
- Emergency fees: RM250-1,000/year
- **3-year cost: RM750-3,000**

**Flat fee advantage:** 24/7 support is included. No emergency fees.

## The REAL 3-Year Comparison (Including Hidden Fees)

Now let's compare with ALL costs included:

| | Commission Model (20%) | Flat Fee Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Gross Revenue (3 years)** | RM30,000 | RM30,000 |
| **Management Fee** | -RM6,000 (20%) | -RM9,000 (RM250/mo) |
| **Cleaning Markup** | -RM4,200 (30% markup) | RM0 |
| **Maintenance Margin** | -RM500 (20% margin) | RM0 |
| **Supplies Markup** | -RM450 (20% markup) | RM0 |
| **Emergency Fees** | -RM1,500 (avg RM50/mo) | RM0 |
| **Platform Fees** | -RM1,500 | -RM1,500 |
| **TOTAL DEDUCTIONS** | **RM14,150** | **RM10,500** |
| **Net to Owner (3 years)** | **RM15,850** | **RM19,500** |
| **Difference** | | **+RM3,650 MORE with flat fee** |

**Flat fee saves you RM3,650 over 3 years** on a RM10,000/year condo.

For higher-earning properties (RM15,000-20,000/year), savings increase to **RM6,000-10,000+ over 3 years.**
