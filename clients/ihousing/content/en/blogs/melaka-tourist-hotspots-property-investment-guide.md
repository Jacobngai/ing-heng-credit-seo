## Location Selection Decision Framework

### Step 1: Define Your Investment Goals

**Option A: Maximum Revenue**
- Target: Dutch Square, Jonker Street
- Accept: Higher entry price, more competition
- Trade-off: Lower ROI due to high entry cost

**Option B: Balanced ROI**
- Target: A Famosa, Klebang Beach, Menara Taming Sari
- Accept: Moderate entry price, moderate competition
- Trade-off: Balanced risk and return

**Option C: Emerging Opportunity**
- Target: Straits Mosque, Portuguese Settlement
- Accept: Lower current demand, less competition
- Trade-off: Growth potential vs current income

**Option D: Stable Long-Term**
- Target: Maritime Museum, A Famosa Resort
- Accept: Moderate revenue, family market
- Trade-off: Consistent demand, lower volatility

### Step 2: Assess Your Budget

**Entry price tiers:**

**Tier 1 (RM300,000-450,000):**
- Portuguese Settlement
- Straits Mosque area
- Bukit China

**Tier 2 (RM450,000-600,000):**
- A Famosa Resort area
- Maritime Museum vicinity
- Klebang Beach

**Tier 3 (RM600,000+):**

### Step 3: Analyze Competition

- Higher quality standards required
- Marketing costs higher

**Low competition areas:**

- Lower marketing costs
- But: Unproven demand

### Step 4: Calculate Target ROI

**ROI formula by hotspot:**

```
Target ROI = (Annual Revenue - Annual Expenses) / Total Investment

Annual Revenue = (Avg Rate × 30 days × Occupancy %) × 12
Annual Expenses = Mortgage + Maintenance + Utilities + Management + Reserves

Target: Minimum 7-8% cash-on-cash return
```
