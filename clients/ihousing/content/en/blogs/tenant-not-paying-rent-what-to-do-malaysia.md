# Tenant Nightmares: When Long-Term Rental Goes Wrong in Malaysia

## Every Landlord's Worst Nightmare

You thought you found the perfect tenant. Good income, verified employment, polite during viewing. They signed the lease, paid the first month's rent and deposit, and moved in.

Then month two arrived. No rent.

Month three? Same story. Texts go unanswered. Calls go to voicemail. When you finally reach them, there's always an excuse: *"Salary delayed,"* *"Family emergency,"* *"Will pay next week for sure."*

By month six, you've had enough. You want them out. But here's the terrifying reality: **in Malaysia, evicting a non-paying tenant can take 12-18 months.**

During this time, you're still paying:
- Mortgage (if any): RM1,500-3,000/month
- Maintenance fees: RM200-500/month
- Assessment charges: RM100-300/month
- Legal fees: RM3,000-10,000+

**Total while fighting eviction: RM20,000-60,000+**

And the tenant? Still living in YOUR property, rent-free, while you fight through Malaysia's slow legal system.

You're not alone. Every experienced landlord in Malaysia has at least one horror story. This article explores your legal options AND presents an alternative that many property owners are discovering: **short-term Airbnb rentals eliminate tenant nightmares completely.**

## 7 Common Tenant Problems in Malaysia

Before diving into eviction law, let's acknowledge the full spectrum of tenant issues landlords face:

### 1. Late or Missed Rent Payments

The most common problem:
- Tenant pays 5-15 days late every month
- Partial payments ("I'll pay the rest next week")
- Complete payment stoppage after 3-6 months
- Checks that bounce or bank transfers that "didn't go through"

**Impact:** Cash flow disruption, stress chasing payments

### 2. Property Damage Beyond Security Deposit

Tenants who don't respect your property:
- Holes in walls from hanging art without permission
- Stained carpets that need professional cleaning
- Broken appliances (air con misuse, washer damage)
- Scratched hardwood floors from pet claws
- Burn marks on countertops from cooking accidents

**Impact:** RM5,000-20,000 in repair costs (deposit only covers RM1,500-3,000)

### 3. Unauthorized Tenants or Pets

Lease says "2 adults maximum." You visit and find:
- 4-5 people living there
- Children (who weren't disclosed)
- Large dogs scratching floors and barking
- Cats with litter box smell issues
- Subletting to strangers on Airbnb without your permission

**Impact:** Wear and tear exceeds normal use, violations of lease terms

### 4. Refusal to Vacate After Lease Ends

Lease ends, tenant won't leave:
- "Can't find another place"
- "Need more time to save for deposit"
- Simply ignoring your notices and continuing to live there
- Changing locks to prevent you from entering

**Impact:** Forced eviction process (12-18 months)

### 5. Utility Bill Defaults

Tenant moves out, leaving unpaid bills:
- Unpaid water bill (water authority can lien property)
- Unpaid electricity (TNB arrears)
- Unpaid internet (contracts in your name)
- You're legally responsible as property owner

**Impact: RM1,000-5,000 in unexpected debt**

### 6. Noise Complaints from Neighbors

Your phone rings at 11 PM:
- Neighbors complaining about loud parties
- Music blasting at 2 AM
- Guests coming and going all night
- Condo management threatening to fine you

**Impact:** Stress, potential fines from condo management, strained relationships

### 7. Subletting Without Permission

Tenant becomes illegal landlord:
- Your condo appears on Airbnb without your knowledge
- Strangers staying in your property
- Tenant collecting profit while risking your investment
- No control over who enters your property

**Impact: RM50,000+ in potential damage, liability issues**

## The Legal Reality: Evicting a Tenant in Malaysia

If you're dealing with a non-paying tenant, here's what Malaysian law actually looks like:

### The Eviction Process (Step-by-Step)

**Phase 1: Demand and Notice (1-2 months)**
1. Send formal demand letter for unpaid rent
2. File notice at Tribunal for Homebuyers
3. Wait for hearing date (can take months)

**Phase 2: Tribunal Hearing (2-4 months)**
1. Attend hearing at Tribunal for Homebuyers
2. Present evidence: unpaid rent, lease agreement, communication
3. Tenant may defend or countersue
4. Tribunal makes decision

**Phase 3: Court Enforcement (6-12 months)**
1. If tenant refuses to leave after Tribunal order
2. File application at High Court for writ of possession
3. Bailiff executes court order (can take months to schedule)
4. **Total timeline: 12-18 months in many cases**

### The Financial Reality of Eviction

| Cost Item | Amount Range |
|-----------|--------------|
| Lost rent (12 months) | RM18,000-36,000 |
| Lawyer fees | RM3,000-10,000 |
| Court fees | RM500-2,000 |
| Maintenance during vacancy | RM2,400-6,000 |
| Property repairs after eviction | RM5,000-20,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **RM28,900-74,000** |

This doesn't even account for the **emotional toll** - 12-18 months of stress, uncertainty, and sleepless nights.

### Why Police Can't Help

One of the most frustrating things landlords learn: **police in Malaysia will not get involved in tenant disputes.**

They'll tell you: *"This is a civil matter. You need to go to court or the Tribunal."*

Your tenant knows this. They know the system is slow, and they know they can live rent-free for months while you navigate the bureaucracy.

## Long-Term Tenants vs Airbnb Guests: What's Different?

Here's a comparison that might surprise you:

| Aspect | Long-Term Tenant | Airbnb Guest |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Commitment** | 12+ months locked in | 1-7 days |
| **Payment Issues** | Monthly arrears possible | Paid upfront before arrival |
| **Damage Risk** | High (lives there daily) | Low (short stays, careful use) |
| **Eviction** | Legal nightmare (12-18 months) | Auto checkout (no action needed) |
| **Screening** | Reference check (limited) | Verified reviews, ID check |
| **Income Potential** | Fixed RM1,500-2,500/month | Variable RM2,500-6,000/month |
| **Control** | You're locked into lease | You choose availability |
| **Property Access** | Limited (tenant rights) | Full access between bookings |
| **Wear and Tear** | High (daily living) | Lower (vacation use) |

### The Key Insight: Airbnb Guests Can't "Squat"

This is the biggest advantage:
- Guests book specific dates (e.g., 3 nights)
- Payment is collected upfront by Airbnb
- Checkout is enforced at 11 AM (or agreed time)
- If they overstay, Airbnb can ban them from the platform
- No need for eviction - they simply leave when their stay ends

**Zero legal battles. Zero court dates. Zero sleepless nights.**

## Why Airbnb Eliminates Tenant Headaches

When we explain this to property owners, the lightbulb moment is real:

### No Long-Term Commitment
- Guests stay 1-7 days, then leave
- You control your calendar - block whenever you want
- No one "moves in" and claims rights to your property

### Payment is Guaranteed
- Airbnb collects payment before guest arrives
- Money held in escrow until 24 hours after checkout
- If damage occurs, you can claim from security deposit
- No chasing tenants for rent

### Guests are Careful
- They're on vacation, not living there permanently
- Reviews matter to them (they want 5-star ratings)
- Bad behavior gets them banned from Airbnb
- Property damage is rare (we see it in <2% of bookings)

### Higher Income Potential
- Weekend rates can be 2-3x weekday rates
- Holiday pricing (CNY, school holidays) premium
- No long-term rental cap (you adjust prices based on demand)

### Professional Management Handles Everything
- We communicate with guests (you never deal with them)
- We coordinate cleaning (your unit is professionally maintained)
- We handle check-ins/outs (key handoff, greeting)
- We screen guests (verification, reviews)

## Real Numbers: Airbnb vs Long-Term Rental Income

Let's compare actual 3-year projections for a RM300,000 condo in Melaka:

**Long-Term Rental Scenario:**
- Monthly rent: RM1,800
- Occupancy: 100% (when tenant is present)
- Vacancy risk: 1-2 months between tenants
- Maintenance: Tenant handles minor issues
- 3-Year Total: ~RM64,800

**Airbnb Scenario (Professionally Managed):**
- Average daily rate: RM200
- Occupancy: 21% (industry average for Melaka)
- Monthly average: RM2,500-4,000
- Maintenance: RM200-400/month (professional cleaning, repairs)
- 3-Year Total: ~RM75,000-105,000

**Difference: +RM10,000-40,000 more with Airbnb over 3 years**

This doesn't even account for the **risk avoidance** - no bad tenants, no legal battles, no eviction nightmares.
