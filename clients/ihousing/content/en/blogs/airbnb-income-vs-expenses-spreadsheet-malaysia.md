# Airbnb Income vs Expenses Spreadsheet: Calculate Your Real Profitability

## Are You Actually Making Money on Airbnb? (Or Just THINKING You Are?)

Many Melaka property owners see RM10,000 in gross annual revenue and think, "Great! I'm earning money from Airbnb!"

But then come the deductions:
- Management fees
- Cleaning costs
- Platform commissions
- Maintenance expenses
- Utility bills
- Condo maintenance fees
- Supplies and essentials

**The real profit? Often 40-50% less than the gross revenue.**

Without proper tracking, you're flying blind. You don't know:
- Your true profit margin
- Which expenses are eating your income
- Your actual ROI on the property
- How you compare to market benchmarks
- Where to optimize for better returns

This article provides a complete income vs. expenses framework, plus a downloadable spreadsheet template to track your Airbnb profitability accurately.

## The 5-Step Profitability Framework

### Step 1: Calculate Gross Revenue (Total Income)

**Gross Revenue = All Money IN Before Any Deductions**

**Revenue Sources to Track:**

| Source | Example | Annual Amount |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Airbnb bookings | 40 bookings × RM180/night | RM7,200 |
| Booking.com bookings | 20 bookings × RM200/night | RM4,000 |
| Agoda bookings | 10 bookings × RM170/night | RM1,700 |
| VRBO bookings | 5 bookings × RM190/night | RM950 |
| Expedia bookings | 3 bookings × RM185/night | RM555 |
| **Total Gross Revenue** | | **RM14,405** |

**Common mistake:** Only tracking Airbnb income and missing other platforms (20-40% of revenue).

---

### Step 2: Track Platform Deductions

**Platform Fees (You Pay to Booking Platforms)**

| Platform | Fee Structure | Typical % | Example (RM14,405 revenue) |
|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Airbnb | 3% service fee | 3% | RM432 |
| Booking.com | 15% commission | 15% | RM600 |
| Agoda | 15% commission | 15% | RM255 |
| VRBO | 8% commission | 8% | RM76 |
| Expedia | 12% commission | 12% | RM67 |
| **Total Platform Fees** | | | **RM1,430 (9.9% of revenue)** |

**Key insight:** Platform fees are unavoidable (this is how they make money). Build this 10% into your pricing strategy.

---

### Step 3: Calculate Operating Expenses

**Fixed Monthly Costs (Regardless of Occupancy)**

| Expense | Monthly | Annual |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Condo Maintenance Fee | RM250-400 | RM3,000-4,800 |
| Assessment Fees | RM50-150 | RM600-1,800 |
| Sinking Fund | RM50-100 | RM600-1,200 |
| Insurance | RM100-200 | RM1,200-2,400 |
| Quit Rent & Assessment | RM50-100 | RM600-1,200 |
| Internet (Unifi/Time) | RM100-200 | RM1,200-2,400 |
| **Total Fixed Costs** | **RM600-1,150** | **RM7,200-13,800** |

**Variable Costs (Scale with Occupancy)**

| Expense | Per Stay | Annual (at 50 stays/year) |
|---------|----------|---------------------------|
| Professional Cleaning | RM80-120 | RM4,000-6,000 |
| Supplies (toilet paper, soap, etc.) | RM30-50 | RM1,500-2,500 |
| Utilities (electricity, water) | RM20-40 | RM1,000-2,000 |
| Wear & Tear Reserve | RM50 | RM2,500 |
| **Total Variable Costs** | **RM180-260/stay** | **RM9,000-13,000** |

**Maintenance & Repairs (Budget 5-10% of Revenue)**

| Category | Annual Budget | Example Use |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Routine Maintenance | RM500-1,000 | AC servicing, pest control |
| Repairs | RM500-1,500 | Appliance replacement, plumbing |
| Replacements | RM300-800 | Furniture, linens, towels |
| Emergency Fund | RM200-500 | Unexpected issues |
| **Total Maintenance Budget** | **RM1,500-3,800** | |

**Management Fees (If You Hire a Manager)**

| Model | Fee Structure | Annual Cost (RM14,405 revenue) |
|-------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Commission-Based | 20-30% of revenue | RM2,881-4,322 |
| Flat Fee | RM200-300/month | RM2,400-3,600 |
| Hybrid | 15% + RM150/month | RM2,661 |

**Important:** Commission-based managers also add markups on cleaning (30-50%), maintenance (15-25%), and supplies (15-30%). These can add another RM2,000-4,000 in hidden costs.

---

### Step 4: Calculate Net Profit

**The Profit Formula:**

```
GROSS REVENUE
- Platform Fees
- Fixed Costs
- Variable Costs
- Maintenance & Repairs
- Management Fees
= NET PROFIT
```

**Real Example: 2-Bedroom Condo in Melaka**

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| **Gross Revenue** | RM14,405 |
| Less: Platform Fees (10%) | -RM1,430 |
| Less: Fixed Costs (maintenance, etc.) | -RM9,600 |
| Less: Variable Costs (cleaning, supplies, utilities) | -RM11,000 |
| Less: Maintenance Budget | -RM2,500 |
| Less: Management Fee (flat fee RM250/month) | -RM3,000 |
| **NET PROFIT** | **RM-3,125** (LOSS) |

**Wait, that's a loss! What happened?**

This example shows a 15% occupancy rate (78 nights/year). At this occupancy, fixed costs eat all profit.

**Same Property at 25% Occupancy (our average):**

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| **Gross Revenue** (130 nights × RM180) | RM23,400 |
| Less: Platform Fees (10%) | -RM2,340 |
| Less: Fixed Costs | -RM9,600 |
| Less: Variable Costs (130 nights ÷ 3 = 43 stays × RM220) | -RM9,460 |
| Less: Maintenance Budget | -RM2,500 |
| Less: Management Fee | -RM3,000 |
| **NET PROFIT** | **RM-3,500** (STILL LOSS?) |

**Fixed costs are too high for this property.** This is why pricing strategy matters.

**Same Property at 25% Occupancy with BETTER PRICING:**

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| **Gross Revenue** (130 nights × RM230) | RM29,900 |
| Less: Platform Fees (10%) | -RM2,990 |
| Less: Fixed Costs | -RM9,600 |
| Less: Variable Costs | -RM9,460 |
| Less: Maintenance Budget | -RM2,500 |
| Less: Management Fee | -RM3,000 |
| **NET PROFIT** | **RM2,350** |

**Now it's profitable.** The difference: RM50/night better pricing = RM6,500 more revenue = profitable.

---

### Step 5: Calculate ROI (Return on Investment)

**ROI Formula:**

```
(Annual Net Profit ÷ Total Property Investment) × 100 = ROI %
```

**Example:**

**Property Investment:**
- Purchase price: RM250,000
- Renovation/furnishing: RM40,000
- **Total investment: RM290,000**

**ROI Calculation:**
```
(RM2,350 net profit ÷ RM290,000 investment) × 100 = 0.8% ROI
```

**That's terrible!** You'd earn more in a fixed deposit.

**How to Improve ROI:**

**Option 1: Increase Occupancy**
- From 25% to 35% (our top performers)
- Revenue: RM29,900 → RM41,860
- Net profit: RM2,350 → RM13,310
- **ROI: 4.6%** (better, still not great)

**Option 2: Better Pricing + Higher Occupancy**
- From RM230/night to RM260/night (dynamic pricing)
- 35% occupancy
- Revenue: RM47,320
- Net profit: RM18,770
- **ROI: 6.5%** (getting better)

**Option 3: Lower Fixed Costs**
- Choose a condo with RM200/month maintenance (vs. RM400)
- Annual fixed costs: RM9,600 → RM6,600
- Savings: RM3,000/year
- With better pricing + 35% occupancy: Net profit RM21,770
- **ROI: 7.5%** (respectable)

**Key lesson:** Property selection matters as much as management.

## Common Profitability Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Not Tracking All Expenses

**The problem:** You only track big expenses (management fee, cleaning) and miss small ones (supplies, utilities, minor repairs).

**Impact:** You think you're earning RM1,500/month, but actual profit is RM900.

**Solution:** Use our spreadsheet template. Track EVERY expense, no matter how small.

---

### Mistake #2: Pricing Too Low

**The problem:** You underprice to attract more guests, but occupancy doesn't increase enough to offset lower rates.

**Example:**
- At RM180/night: 20% occupancy = RM13,140/year revenue
- At RM230/night: 15% occupancy = RM12,568/year revenue
- **Lower occupancy at higher price = MORE revenue**

**Solution:** Use dynamic pricing. Adjust rates based on demand, not gut feeling.

---

### Mistake #3: Choosing High-Maintenance Properties

**The problem:** You buy a condo with RM500/month maintenance fees.

**Impact:**
- Annual fixed cost: RM6,000 more than low-maintenance condo
- Must earn RM6,000 more just to break even
- Takes 2-3 years to recover higher purchase price

**Solution:** When purchasing, factor in ALL fixed costs, not just price per sqft.

---

### Mistake #4: Single-Platform Listing

**The problem:** You're only listed on Airbnb.

**Impact:** You're missing 40-50% of potential bookings.

**Solution:** List on minimum 3 platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com, Agoda). Ideally 5 platforms.

---

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Seasonal Trends

**The problem:** Same price year-round.

**Reality:**
- Peak seasons (school holidays, CNY, weekends): Can charge 30-50% more
- Low seasons (some weekdays, rainy months): May need to discount 20-30%

**Solution:** Dynamic pricing that adjusts for demand.

---

### Mistake #6: Skipping Preventive Maintenance

**The problem:** Not servicing AC, not replacing worn items.

**Impact:**
- Poor guest reviews ("AC wasn't cold," "mattress was lumpy")
- Lower occupancy due to bad reviews
- Expensive emergency repairs (RM3,000+ vs. RM300 annual service)

**Solution:** Budget RM1,000-1,500/year for preventive maintenance.

---

## Break-Even Analysis: When Does Airbnb Become Profitable?

**The Break-Even Formula:**

```
Fixed Costs (annual) ÷ (Average Daily Rate × Occupancy Rate × 365 - Variable Costs per Night)
= Break-Even Point (in nights)
```

**Example: 2-Bedroom Condo**

**Fixed Costs:** RM9,600/year
**Variable Costs:** RM180/stay
**Average Stay:** 3 nights
**Variable Cost per Night:** RM60 (RM180 ÷ 3)
**Average Daily Rate:** RM230

**Calculation:**
```
RM9,600 ÷ (RM230 - RM60) = RM9,600 ÷ RM170 = 56 nights
```

**This property needs 56 booked nights per year to break even.**

**At 25% occupancy:** 91 nights = profitable
**At 15% occupancy:** 55 nights = break even
**At 10% occupancy:** 37 nights = loss

**Key insight:** Low occupancy properties often lose money. 20%+ occupancy needed for profitability.

---

## How to Improve Your Profitability

### Strategy 1: Increase Occupancy

**Target:** 25%+ occupancy (Melaka market average: 19-22%)

**How:**
- Professional photography (better listing visibility)
- Multi-platform listing (5 platforms = 60% more bookings)
- Dynamic pricing (adjust for demand automatically)
- 24/7 guest response (better ranking)
- Quality guest experience (better reviews = more bookings)

**Typical improvement:** From 15% to 25% occupancy = +RM4,000-8,000/year revenue

---

### Strategy 2: Optimize Pricing

**Target:** RM200-300/night depending on unit size

**How:**
- Use dynamic pricing tools (adjust daily based on demand)
- Monitor competitor pricing
- Charge premiums for peak periods (+30-50%)
- Offer discounts for low periods (-20-30%)
- Minimum stay requirements (2-3 nights minimum)

**Typical improvement:** +15-25% average daily rate = +RM2,000-5,000/year revenue

---

### Strategy 3: Reduce Fixed Costs

**Target:** Keep fixed costs under RM8,000/year

**How:**
- Choose condos with lower maintenance fees (RM200-300/month vs. RM400-500)
- Negotiate insurance rates annually
- Opt for cost-effective internet packages
- Choose properties with reasonable assessment fees

**Typical improvement:** Save RM1,500-3,000/year

---

### Strategy 4: Control Variable Costs

**Target:** RM200 or less per stay

**How:**
- In-house cleaning (no markup)
- Bulk buying supplies
- Energy-efficient appliances
- Quality furniture that lasts longer

**Typical improvement:** Save RM1,000-2,000/year

---

### Strategy 5: Switch to Flat-Fee Management

**Target:** Reduce management cost from 30%+ to 20-25% effective

**How:**
- Choose flat-fee manager (RM200-300/month for Parkland)
- Or negotiate custom pricing with transparency
- Avoid commission + markups model

**Typical improvement:** Save RM1,500-4,000/year

---

## Real Example: Optimizing an Underperforming Property

**Before Optimization (Imperio Residence, 2-Bedroom):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Occupancy | 13% (47 nights/year) |
| Daily Rate | RM170/night (static) |
| Gross Revenue | RM7,990 |
| Platform Fees | -RM800 |
| Fixed Costs | -RM10,200 |
| Variable Costs | -RM6,580 |
| Maintenance | -RM2,000 |
| Management Fee (25% commission) | -RM2,000 |
| **Net Profit** | **RM-13,590 (LOSS)** |

**After Optimization (iHousing):**

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Professional photos | +5% occupancy |
| 5-platform listing | +8% occupancy |
| Dynamic pricing | +RM40/night average |
| In-house cleaning | -RM1,200/year |
| Flat fee management | -RM800/year |

**New Performance:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Occupancy | 26% (95 nights/year) |
| Daily Rate | RM210/night (dynamic) |
| Gross Revenue | RM19,950 |
| Platform Fees | -RM2,000 |
| Fixed Costs | -RM10,200 |
| Variable Costs | -RM13,300 |
| Maintenance | -RM2,500 |
| Management Fee (flat RM250/month) | -RM3,000 |
| **Net Profit** | **RM-11,050 (STILL LOSS?)** |

**Wait, still a loss? What's wrong?**

**Fixed costs are too high for this property.** RM10,200/year in fixed costs (mostly condo maintenance fee of RM600/month) is the problem.

**The real lesson:** Property selection matters more than management.

**Better Property Choice (Melaka Raya, lower maintenance):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Occupancy | 26% (95 nights/year) |
| Daily Rate | RM210/night |
| Gross Revenue | RM19,950 |
| Platform Fees | -RM2,000 |
| Fixed Costs | -RM6,600 (RM300/month less than Imperio) |
| Variable Costs | -RM13,300 |
| Maintenance | -RM2,500 |
| Management Fee | -RM3,000 |
| **Net Profit** | **RM-7,550 (getting closer)** |

**Even with better property selection, this unit is marginal.**

**Best approach:** Choose a different property or use for long-term rental instead.
