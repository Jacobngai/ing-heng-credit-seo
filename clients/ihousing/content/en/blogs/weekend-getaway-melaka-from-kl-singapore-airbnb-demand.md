## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Are weekdays really that bad for occupancy?
**A:** Weekday occupancy is lower (40-50% vs 70-80% weekends), but you compensate with higher weekend rates. Many owners block weekdays entirely and just focus on weekends - still profitable.

### Q: How far in advance do weekend guests book?
**A:** Varies by season. Regular weekends: 1-2 weeks. School holidays: 2-4 weeks. CNY: 1-2 months. We recommend booking your own stays at least 3 weeks out.

### Q: Should I accept 1-night bookings on weekends?
**A:** Generally yes for 1-night gaps between bookings. But for prime weekends (CNY, school holidays), require 2-night minimums to maximize revenue.

### Q: What if I want to use the property myself on weekends?
**A:** No problem! Block the dates you want. Weekend rates are highest, so you'll sacrifice income, but it's your property. Many owners use during weekdays (lower occupancy) and rent weekends.

### Q: Is it too late to invest? Is the market saturated?
**A:** Far from it. Melaka has 16 million potential weekend guests within 3-hour drive. Supply is growing but demand is growing faster. Best time to invest was yesterday; second-best time is today.
