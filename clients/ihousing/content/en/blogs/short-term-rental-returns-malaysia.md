# Short Term Rental Returns Malaysia: What to Really Expect in 2025

The numbers are tempting. You've seen the listings claiming RM15,000/month in rental income. You've heard stories of Airbnb hosts killing it with 80% occupancy and premium nightly rates.

But **what's the reality of short-term rental returns in Malaysia?**

Can you really make 2-3x more than long-term rental? Or is it all hype with hidden headaches and diminishing returns?

At iHousing Melaka, we manage dozens of short-term rental properties across the city. We have real data, not hypothetical projections. Let's break down exactly what you can expect from short-term rental investments in Malaysia in 2025.

## The Big Picture: Short-Term vs Long-Term Rental

Let's start with a direct comparison using a typical 2-bedroom condo in a tourist-friendly area like Melaka.

### Long-Term Rental (12-Month Lease)

| Metric | Typical Figure |
|--------|---------------|
| Monthly rental income | RM1,800-2,500 |
| Occupancy | 100% (lease-based) |
| Tenant wear and tear | Higher risk |
| Rental stability | Very high |
| Annual income | RM21,600-30,000 |

### Short-Term Rental (Airbnb/Booking.com)

| Metric | Typical Figure |
|--------|---------------|
| Monthly rental income | RM3,000-6,000+ |
| Occupancy | 60-75% (well-managed) |
| Guest wear and tear | Lower (professional cleaning) |
| Income stability | Variable (seasonal) |
| Annual income | RM36,000-72,000+ |

**The verdict:** Well-managed short-term rentals in good locations can genuinely earn **1.5x to 2.5x** more than long-term rental.

But—and this is important—**"well-managed" is the critical variable.** Poorly managed properties may earn less than long-term rental after accounting for higher operational costs.

## What Drives Short-Term Rental Returns?

Understanding the variables that impact your returns is essential for realistic expectations.

### 1. Location (The #1 Factor)

**Premium Locations:**
- Beachfront (Klebang): 15-25% higher rates
- Walking distance to attractions (Jonker Street area): 10-20% premium
- City centre (Melaka Raya): Consistent demand

**Secondary Locations:**
- 10-15 minutes from attractions: 10-15% lower rates
- Residential areas: Lower rates, more weekday demand

**Impact on returns:** A premium location can generate 30-50% higher revenue despite only 10-15% higher property prices.

### 2. Property Type and Size

| Property Type | Nightly Rate Range | Occupancy Range | Monthly Revenue |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Studio | RM80-120 | 70-80% | RM2,400-4,000 |
| 1-Bedroom | RM100-150 | 65-75% | RM2,700-4,800 |
| 2-Bedroom | RM120-200 | 60-75% | RM3,000-6,000 |
| 3-Bedroom | RM180-280 | 55-70% | RM3,500-7,500 |

**Sweet spot:** 2-bedroom units offer the best balance of rates and occupancy for family-oriented destinations like Melaka.

### 3. Furnishing and Presentation

**Well-furnished properties earn 20-30% more:**
- Professional photography: +15-20% in bookings
- Resort-style furnishings: +10-15% in rates
- Smart home features: +5-10% in guest satisfaction
- Quality linens and amenities: Critical for reviews

**Furnishing investment:**
- Basic functional: RM15,000-20,000
- Standard Airbnb-ready: RM20,000-30,000
- Premium resort-style: RM30,000-45,000

**ROI on furnishing:** Premium furnishing pays for itself in 12-18 months through higher rates and occupancy.

### 4. Management Quality

**DIY vs Professional Management:**

| Factor | DIY | Professional Management |
|--------|-----|------------------------|
| Occupancy | 50-60% | 65-75% |
| Nightly rates | Market | Optimised (dynamic pricing) |
| Guest satisfaction | Variable | Consistently high |
| Response time | When you're available | 24/7 |
| Reviews | Average | Superhost status |
| **Net income impact** | -20% to -30% | +15% to +25% |

**The management paradox:** Professional management costs money but typically increases net income by 20-40% through better occupancy, rates, and reviews.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Returns

### Mistake 1: Underestimating Furnishing Costs

Trying to furnish on the cheap backfires:
- Poor photos = fewer bookings
- Bad reviews = lower ratings
- Lower rates = less revenue

**Solution:** Budget RM20,000-35,000 for proper furnishing.

### Mistake 2: DIY Management to "Save Money"

DIY sounds free but costs you:
- Lower occupancy (no 24/7 response)
- Lower rates (no dynamic pricing)
- Bad reviews (delayed responses)
- Guest fatigue (you burn out)

**Solution:** Professional management increases net income despite the fee.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Professional Photography

Listing with phone photos underperforms by 30-40% in bookings.

**Solution:** Invest RM300-600 in professional photography. Pays for itself in a month.

### Mistake 4: Not Optimising Pricing

Fixed pricing leaves money on the table:
- Underpricing on peak dates
- Overpricing on low-demand days
- Missing booking opportunities

**Solution:** Dynamic pricing adjusts rates daily based on demand.

### Mistake 5: Choosing the Wrong Location

Buying in areas with low tourist demand guarantees underperformance.

**Solution:** Research thoroughly. Focus on proven tourist areas.

---

## Financing Impact: Leveraging for Higher Returns

If you're financing your purchase, here's how it affects returns:

### 70% Loan Scenario (RM300,000 loan at 4.5% interest)

**Monthly mortgage:** RM1,520
**Net income after mortgage:** RM3,100 (from Scenario 2)
**Positive cash flow:** RM1,580/month
**Cash-on-cash return:** 55% on RM90,000 down payment

**The power of leverage:** Financing can dramatically increase your percentage return on actual cash invested.

---

## Tax Considerations

Malaysia's tax treatment for short-term rental income:

### Taxable Income
- Rental profit is taxable income
- Expenses are deductible
- Maintenance and furnishing can be claimed

### RPGT (Real Property Gains Tax)
- Held <3 years: 30% tax on gains
- Held 3-5 years: 20% tax on gains
- Held >5 years: 5% tax on gains
- Held >10 years: 0% tax on gains

**Strategy:** Hold for 5+ years to minimise RPGT on sale.
