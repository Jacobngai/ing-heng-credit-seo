## Calculate Your Condo's Airbnb Potential

Use this simple estimator to gauge your Melaka condo's potential:

### Step 1: Select Your Unit Type

| Unit Type | Base Monthly Income |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Studio (400-600 sqft) | RM400-700 |
| 1 Bedroom (600-800 sqft) | RM600-900 |
| 2 Bedroom (800-1,000 sqft) | RM700-1,100 |
| 3 Bedroom (1,000+ sqft) | RM900-1,400 |

### Step 2: Apply Location Multiplier

| Location | Multiplier |
|----------|-----------|
| Jonker Street / UNESCO Area | x 1.3 |
