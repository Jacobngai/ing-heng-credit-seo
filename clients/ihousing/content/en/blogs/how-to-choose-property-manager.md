# How to Choose Property Manager for Airbnb in Malaysia: 2025 Guide

**You're about to hand over the keys to your RM500,000+ investment.**

The property manager will:
- Control your cash flow
- Deal with guests (your reputation)
- Make decisions affecting your asset
- Take a percentage of your revenue

**Choose wrong, and you're trapped in a 12-24 month contract with:**
- Poor occupancy (watching competitors get booked)
- Hidden fees eroding profits
- Guest complaints damaging reviews
- Difficult exit process

**Choose right, and you enjoy:**
- Hands-free passive income
- 60%+ occupancy
- 5-star guest reviews
- Peace of mind

**This guide shows you exactly how to evaluate and choose the right Airbnb property manager in Malaysia.**

---

## Step 1: Define Your Priorities

### What Matters Most to You?

**Before interviewing managers, clarify your goals:**

| Priority Type | Questions to Ask Yourself |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Revenue-Focused** | Is maximum income your #1 goal? Are you willing to pay more for better performance? |
| **Hands-Off** | Do you want ZERO involvement? Or are you okay with occasional decisions? |
| **Quality-Focused** | Is maintaining your property in top condition more important than squeezing every dollar? |
| **Growth-Focused** | Are you building a portfolio? Need a manager who can scale with you? |
| **Budget-Conscious** | Are fees a major concern? Willing to trade some performance for lower costs? |

**Why This Matters:**
Different managers excel at different things. Knowing your priorities helps you choose the right fit.

---

**Example Profiles:**

**The "Maximize Income" Owner:**
- Priority: Highest possible revenue
- Trade-offs: Willing to pay higher fees for better performance
- Best Manager: Results-focused, proven track record, premium pricing

**The "Hands-Off" Owner:**
- Priority: Zero involvement, zero stress
- Trade-offs: Okay with slightly lower revenue for complete peace of mind
- Best Manager: Full-service, responsive, transparent reporting

**The "Portfolio Builder":**
- Priority: Scalability, consistency across properties
- Trade-offs: Willing to commit longer-term for right partner
- Best Manager: Established, multiple condos, scalable systems

---

## Step 2: Initial Screening (Do This BEFORE Meeting)

### Online Presence Check

**Red Flags at First Glance:**

| Issue | Why It's a Red Flag |
|-------|---------------------|
| **No website** | Unprofessional, fly-by-night |
| **Vague services** | Hiding what they actually do |
| **No pricing transparency** | Hidden fees coming |
| **Few/no testimonials** | No track record or unhappy clients |
| **Poor grammar/Spelling** | Lack of attention to detail = poor service |

---

**Green Flags:**
- Professional website with clear services
- Transparent pricing (or clear "contact for quote")
- Specific property examples (which condos they manage)
- Verifiable testimonials
- Active social media with guest reviews
- Professional photos of managed properties

---

### Portfolio Size Check

**Ask (or check online):**
- "How many properties do you manage?"
- "How long have you been operating?"
- "Which condos/areas do you cover?"

**Green Flags:**
- 50+ properties
- 3+ years in operation
- Multiple locations/condos

**Red Flags:**
- "We're launching soon" (unproven)
- 5-10 properties (too small for efficiency)
- 1-2 years experience (may not survive downturn)
- Only 1 condo (limited market knowledge)

**Ideal:** 50+ properties, 3+ years, multiple locations

---

## Step 3: The Interview (Questions to Ask)

### Category 1: Performance & Track Record

**Q1: "What is your average occupancy rate?"**

**Good Answer:** "We achieve 60%+ average occupancy across our portfolio. For similar 2-bedroom units in [Your Condo], we're seeing 35-40%."

**Red Flag Answer:** "We maximize occupancy" or "It depends on the property" (vague, hiding poor performance)

**Q2: "Can you show performance data from properties similar to mine?"**

**Good Answer:** "Absolutely. Here's a 2-bedroom in Silverscape we manage: [shows data with occupancy, revenue, expenses]."

**Red Flag Answer:** "We don't share client data" or "Every property is different" (avoiding transparency)

**Q3: "What is your typical guest review score?"**

**Good Answer:** "Our average is 4.8/5 across all properties. Here are some recent guest reviews."

**Red Flag Answer:** "Mostly 5-star" or "Great reviews" (no specific data)

---

### Category 2: Fees & Pricing Structure

**Q4: "What is your EXACT management fee? Are there ANY other fees?"**

**Good Answer:** "We charge [specific amount or %]. This includes [list what's included]. There are no other fees except [specific exceptions]."

**Red Flag Answer:** "We're competitive" or "Plus standard expenses" (vague, hidden costs coming)

**Q5: "Do you markup cleaning or maintenance costs?"**

**Good Answer:** "No markup. We pass through actual costs. Or: We have in-house cleaning so no markup."

**Red Flag Answer:** "Standard industry markup" or "A small admin fee" (hidden cost)

**Q6: "Who pays platform fees (Airbnb, Booking.com)?"**

**Good Answer:** "Platform fees are charged to you, usually 3% per booking. We'll itemize this in your monthly statement."

**Red Flag Answer:** Unclear or doesn't mention it (likely passing through to you without disclosure)

---

### Category 3: Services & Operations

**Q7: "What platforms do you list on?"**

**Good Answer:** "We list on 5 platforms: Airbnb, Booking.com, Agoda, VRBO, and Expedia with automated calendar sync."

**Red Flag Answer:** "Mostly Airbnb" or "We use the major platforms" (likely 1-2 platforms only)

**Q8: "What is your response time for guest inquiries?"**

**Good Answer:** "We respond within 1 hour during business hours, 4 hours maximum 24/7."

**Red Flag Answer:** "Within 24 hours" (too slow - guests book elsewhere)

**Q9: "Do you provide professional photography?"**

**Good Answer:** "Yes, included in our setup. We have a professional photographer we work with."

**Red Flag Answer:** "Optional extra" or "We can help arrange" (not included = extra cost RM800-1,500)

**Q10: "How do you handle cleaning and maintenance?"**

**Good Answer:** "We have an in-house cleaning team for consistency. For maintenance, we coordinate trusted contractors and don't markup costs."

**Red Flag Answer:** "We arrange third-party services" (markup likely) or vague about process

---

### Category 4: Contract & Exit Terms

**Q11: "What is the contract length?"**

**Good Answer:** "12 months standard."

**Red Flag Answer:** "24 months" or "Minimum 18 months" (long lock-in)

**Q12: "Can I terminate early? Under what terms?"**

**Good Answer:** "Yes, with 30-day written notice. No penalty."

**Red Flag Answer:** "Early termination fee of RM5,000" or "Contract is binding for full term" (trapped)

**Q13: "What happens to my existing bookings if I switch managers?"**

**Good Answer:** "We honor all existing reservations and ensure smooth transition. No guest disruption."

**Red Flag Answer:** Unclear or "we'll discuss it" (potential booking loss)

---

### Category 5: References & Verification

**Q14: "Can I speak to 2-3 existing owners?"**

**Good Answer:** "Absolutely. Here are contact details for owners with properties similar to yours."

**Red Flag Answer:** "Our clients prefer privacy" (hiding poor performance)

**Q15: "Can I visit a managed property?"**

**Good Answer:** "Yes, we can arrange a viewing. We have several owners who allow this."

**Red Flag Answer:** "We don't do property visits" (what are they hiding?)

---

## Step 4: Reference Checking (Do This!)

### Why References Matter

**Online reviews can be faked.**
**Direct owner conversations cannot.**

**What to Ask Owners:**

**Performance:**
- "What occupancy rate are you achieving?"
- "How does this compare to when you managed yourself (if applicable)?"
- "Have you had any issues with the manager?"

**Service Quality:**
- "How responsive are they to issues?"
- "How's the cleaning quality?"
- "Any surprises in fees or costs?"

**Overall Satisfaction:**
- "Would you recommend this manager?"
- "What's their biggest strength?"
- "What's their biggest weakness?"

**Red Flags from Owners:**
- Hesitation to recommend
- Vague praise ("they're nice" vs. "they achieved 65% occupancy")
- Complaints about hidden fees
- Poor communication stories
- Difficulties leaving the contract

---

## Step 5: The Proposal Evaluation

### What Should Be Included

**A professional manager's proposal should include:**

**1. Performance Projection**
- Expected occupancy rate
- Expected daily rate
- Expected annual revenue
- Comparison to market average

**2. Fee Breakdown**
- Exact management fee
- Any additional costs
- What's included vs. extra

**3. Services Detail**
- Setup process (if applicable)
- Ongoing services
- Reporting frequency
- Communication channels

**4. Contract Summary**
- Term length
- Termination terms
- Performance clauses (if any)
- Exclusivity requirements

**5. Timeline**
- When they can start
- Setup timeframe
- First booking expectations

---

### Red Flags in Proposals

**Vague Projections:**
- "We'll maximize your revenue" (no numbers)
- "Above-market occupancy" (unsubstantiated)

**Hidden Fees:**
- "Plus standard expenses" (what are they?)
- "Admin fees may apply" (how much?)
- Cleaning/markup not mentioned (they're there)

**Unrealistic Promises:**
- "90% occupancy guaranteed" (impossible, lying)
- "Double your revenue overnight" (unrealistic)
- "No vacancy ever" (impossible)

**Poor Presentation:**
- Typos, formatting errors
- Unprofessional appearance
- Missing key information
- Template-like, not customized

---

## Step 6: The Final Decision Framework

### Scorecard Approach

**Rate each manager on these criteria (1-5 scale):**

| Criteria | Weight | Manager A | Manager B | Manager C |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Track Record** | 20% | | | |
| **Performance Data** | 20% | | | |
| **Fee Structure** | 15% | | | |
| **Services Included** | 15% | | | |
| **Contract Terms** | 10% | | | |
| **References** | 10% | | | |
| **Communication** | 10% | | | |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | | | |

**Calculate weighted scores. Highest wins.**

---

### When to Choose Flat Fee vs. Commission

**Flat Fee (Like iHousing Parkland):**
- **Pros:** Know exact cost, no revenue sharing, higher net income
- **Cons:** Manager takes risk if occupancy low
- **Best For:** Properties with good occupancy potential, owners wanting cost certainty

**Commission-Based:**
- **Pros:** Manager motivated to maximize revenue
- **Cons:** Uncertain monthly costs, fees grow with revenue
- **Best For:** Higher-end properties, owners wanting performance-based fee

**iHousing Hybrid:**
- Parkland: Flat fee (predictable)
- Other condos: Custom quotes (tailored to property)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Choosing Based on Lowest Fee

**Scenario:**
- Manager A: 15% commission, 19% occupancy
- Manager B: 25% commission, 35% occupancy

**RM70,000 Revenue Scenario:**
- Manager A: RM70,000 - RM10,500 fee = RM59,500
- Manager B: RM70,000 - RM17,500 fee = RM52,500

**Wait:** Manager B achieves HIGHER occupancy, so:
- Manager A actual: RM35,000 revenue - RM5,250 = RM29,750
- Manager B actual: RM70,000 revenue - RM17,500 = RM52,500

**Winner:** Higher-fee Manager B = RM22,750 MORE net income

**Lesson:** Focus on NET income, not fee percentage.

---

### Mistake #2: Not Verifying Performance

**What Managers Claim:**
- "We achieve high occupancy"
- "Our owners are very happy"
- "Great returns"

**What You Should Verify:**
- Actual occupancy numbers
- Real owner testimonials (contact them)
- Specific property examples
- Performance data with proof

**If They Won't Provide Data:** Walk away.

---

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Contract Terms

**Dangerous Clauses:**
- Automatic renewal (traps you for years)
- Early termination penalties (RM5,000+ to leave)
- Performance minimums not met (they still get paid)
- Ownership of listings (if you leave, you lose everything)

**Safe Contract Terms:**
- 12-month maximum
- 30-day notice to terminate
- No penalties for leaving
- Performance-based exit option (if they underperform)
- You own your listings

---

### Mistake #4: Not Testing Service First

**Before Committing, Test:**
1. **WhatsApp them** - how fast is response?
2. **Ask for data** - do they provide specific numbers?
3. **Request references** - do they share owner contacts?
4. **Visit a property** - are they transparent?

**If They Fail These Tests:** Don't sign.

---

### Mistake #5: Signing Long Contracts Initially

**Never sign 24+ months upfront.**

**Why:**
- You don't know if they'll deliver
- You're trapped if they underperform
- Exit is difficult/expensive

**Better Approach:**
- Start with 12 months
- Renew if happy
- Leave if not
