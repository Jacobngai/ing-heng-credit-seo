**Pro Tip:** Invest in a **sofa bed** for the living room (RM1,500-3,000). It allows your unit to accommodate 2 additional guests, increasing your booking potential by 40%+.

---

### Bedroom (RM3,000 - RM20,000 per room)

The bedroom is where guests spend 70% of their time - comfort here drives your reviews.

#### Essential Items (Budget: RM3K-10K per bedroom)

| **Item** | **Budget Option** | **Standard Option** | **Premium Option** |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Bed frame (Queen/King) | RM400-800 (metal/basic wood) | RM1,200-2,500 (solid wood/design) | RM3,000-6,000 (teak/platform) |

**Budget:** RM800-2,000 for Queen, RM1,000-2,500 for King
**Recommended brands:** Simmons, Sealy, Serta (mid-range), or local brands like Dreamland or Slumberland

#### Toiletries: The Little Details That Matter

**Starter Set (RM100-300):**
- Body wash (2 bottles)
- Shampoo & conditioner (2 sets)
- Hand soap (1 pump bottle)
- Toothbrush holders (2)
- Toilet paper (4-6 rolls)

**Pro Tip:** Buy toiletries in bulk from wholesale suppliers (AEON BiG, Tesco). RM500 of bulk supplies lasts 6-12 months and reduces your per-guest cost to RM8-15/stay.

## Money-Saving Tips (Without Sacrificing Quality)

### 1. Prioritize the "Big Three"

If you have a tight budget, allocate more to:
1. **Mattress** (affects 70% of guest experience)
2. **Sofa** (first impression in photos + comfort)
3. **Smart lock** (eliminates key handoff costs)

These three items drive 80% of guest satisfaction. Everything else can be upgraded later.

### 2. Buy Second-Hand for These Items (Safe)

- Dining tables and chairs
- Coffee tables
- TV consoles
- Bedside tables
- Lamps and lighting fixtures
- Decor pieces

**Never buy second-hand:** Mattresses, sofas, upholstered chairs (hygiene/bedbug risk)

### 3. Time Your Purchases

**Best Sales Periods:**
- **Chinese New Year (Jan/Feb):** 11.11 mega sales, Mega 11 sales
- **Mid-Year Sale (June):** 6.6 sales on Lazada/Shopee
- **Year-End (December):** 12.12 sales, clearance sales

**Potential savings:** 15-40% on furniture and appliances

### 4. Bundle Purchases

Many suppliers offer 10-20% discounts when you:
- Buy a full bedroom set (bed + mattress + bedside tables + wardrobe)
- Furnish an entire condo with one supplier
- Buy in bulk (if furnishing multiple units)

**Ask for:** "Airbnb owner discount" or "bulk furnishing package"

### 5. Start Minimal, Upgrade Based on Reviews

Launch with:
- Essential furniture only
- Basic decor
- Minimum kitchen equipment

After 20-30 guest reviews, identify:
- What guests compliment (keep/buy more)
- What guests complain about (upgrade immediately)
- What's never mentioned (optional upgrade later)

## Common Furnishing Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Over-Furnishing

**Problem:** Buying too much furniture makes spaces feel cramped and difficult to clean.

**Solution:** Leave 20-30% empty space for movement and visual breathing room. Guests prefer spacious over fully-furnished.

### Mistake #2: Buying All White Furniture

**Problem:** White shows stains, wear, and requires replacement every 2-3 years.

**Solution:** Choose neutral colors (grey, beige, navy) or patterns. 40% longer lifespan, easier maintenance.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Storage Space

**Problem:** Guests have nowhere to unpack luggage or store belongings.

**Solution:** Wardrobe with hangers, empty drawer space, luggage rack. 4.7+ rating requirement.

### Mistake #4: Cheap Mattress, Expensive Decor

**Problem:** Prioritizing aesthetics over guest comfort kills reviews.

**Solution:** Spend 60% of your bedroom budget on mattress + bedding. 20% on furniture, 20% on decor.

### Mistake #5: No Blackout Curtains

**Problem:** Guests wake up at 6am from sunlight, leave negative reviews.

**Solution:** Blackout curtains in EVERY bedroom (RM400-800). Eliminates the #1 guest complaint globally.
