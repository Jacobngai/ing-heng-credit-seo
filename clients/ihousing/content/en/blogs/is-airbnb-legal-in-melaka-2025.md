# Is Airbnb Legal in Melaka 2025? Complete Guide for Property Owners

**Short Answer: YES, Airbnb is legal in Melaka in 2025.**

Unlike Selangor's restrictive 6-month rule, Melaka has **no specific laws prohibiting short-term rentals**. This makes Melaka one of the most Airbnb-friendly states in Malaysia.

## Quick Summary: Melaka vs Other States

| State | Airbnb Legal? | Restrictions | Notes |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| **Melaka** | ✅ YES | None | No specific STR laws yet |
| **Selangor** | ⚠️ Limited | 6-month minimum | Must rent 6+ months |
| **Penang** | ⚠️ Mixed | Some restrictions | Heritage area rules |
| **Kuala Lumpur** | ✅ YES | Strata-dependent | Building management decides |

**Melaka Advantage:** No minimum stay requirement. You can rent nightly, weekly, or monthly - whatever maximizes your income.

## Understanding Melaka's Regulatory Status (2025)

### Current Legal Status

As of January 2025:

1. **No State-Level Ban**: Melaka state government has not enacted laws prohibiting short-term rentals
2. **No Licensing Required**: Unlike hotels, Airbnb condos don't need tourism licenses (yet)
3. **No Minimum Stay**: Unlike Selangor, you can accept 1-night bookings
4. **No Income Cap**: Earn as much as your property can generate

### What's Coming? (Future Regulations)

The Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MOTAC) has **discussed** requiring STR licenses, but:

- **Not yet implemented** as of 2025
- Would apply nationwide, not Melaka-specific
- Likely to focus on **registration** rather than prohibition
- Grandfathering expected for existing hosts

**Recommendation:** Start now while regulations are still friendly. Future hosts may face stricter requirements.

## Condo vs Landed Property: Different Rules

### Strata-Titled Condos (Apartments, Service Residences)

**The Challenge:** Each condo's management corporation sets its own rules.

**Common Condo Restrictions:**
- No commercial activity (Airbnb may fall under this)
- Minimum rental period (30 days, 6 months, etc.)
- Guest registration requirements
- Parking limitations

**Airbnb-Friendly Condos in Melaka:**
We manage 10+ condos that **allow short-term rentals**, including:
- Silverscape Residence
- The Shore Residence
- Imperio Residence
- Ong Kim Wee Residence
- Novo 8 Residence
- Century Mahkota Hotel Residence
- And more...

**Before Buying:** Always check with the building management if Airbnb is allowed. We can help verify this for condos we manage.

### Landed Properties (Terrace Houses, Bungalows)

**Easier Rules:** Landed properties typically have fewer restrictions:
- No strata management to deal with
- No condo committee approval needed
- More freedom to operate

**Trade-off:** Lower occupancy compared to prime condo locations near Jonker Street.

---

## What If Your Condo Bans Airbnb?

**Don't panic.** You have options:

### Option 1: Petition for Rule Change
- Gather support from other owners
- Present data on security benefits (short-term = more eyes on property)
- Show how it increases property values

### Option 2: Switch to Long-Term Rental
- Less income but guaranteed cash flow
- 6-12 month leases
- We can help with tenant placement

### Option 3: Sell and Buy Airbnb-Friendly Property
- We can recommend condos that allow STR
- Calculate ROI before buying
- Avoid costly mistakes

## Compliance Checklist (What You SHOULD Do)

## Melaka vs Selangor: Why Melaka Wins

**Selangor's 6-Month Rule:**
- Must rent minimum 6 months at a time
- Airbnb essentially banned for short stays
- Drastically reduces income potential

**Example (Selangor vs Melaka):**

| Scenario | Selangor (6-month rental) | Melaka (Airbnb) |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Monthly Rate | RM 2,000 | RM 3,000 (avg) |
| Occupancy | 100% (6-month lease) | 60% (weekends + holidays) |
| Annual Income | RM 24,000 | RM 36,000+ |
| Flexibility | Low (locked in) | High (use property anytime) |

**Winner:** Melaka earns **50% more** with greater flexibility.
