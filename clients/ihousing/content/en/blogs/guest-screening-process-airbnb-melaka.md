# Guest Screening Process: How We Protect Your Airbnb Property in Melaka

**"What if they trash my place?"**

That's the number one fear we hear from new Airbnb owners in Melaka. You've invested RM400,000+ in your Silverscape or Parkland unit, and now you're letting strangers stay there.

Terrifying, right?

Here's what we've learned managing over 100 properties in Melaka: **Bad guests are rare, but preventable.** The key is knowing what to look for *before* they book.

Let me walk you through exactly how we screen guests at iHousing — the same process that's protected our owners' properties for 10,000+ stays.

---

## Why Guest Screening Matters in Melaka

Unlike long-term rentals where you meet tenants face-to-face, Airbnb guests book instantly. You get a notification, they get a key code, and suddenly someone's sleeping in your condo.

**The risks we've seen in Melaka:**
- Party groups (especially CNY and long weekends)
- Unauthorized subletting (booking for 2, hosting 10)
- Smoking damage (RM3,000+ to remove smell)
- Pet damage (despite no-pet policies)
- Theft of furnishings or electronics

One bad guest can wipe out 3 months of profit. That's why screening isn't optional — it's insurance.

## The iHousing 5-Step Screening Process

### Step 1: Profile Age Check

**What we look for:**
- Account created >6 months ago (GREEN FLAG)
- Account created yesterday + booking today (RED FLAG)

**Why it matters:**
Problem guests often create fresh accounts because their old one got banned. New accounts aren't automatically rejected, but they trigger extra verification.

**Real example:**
> Guest from Singapore tried booking a Jonker Walk property for CNY. Account was 2 days old, no profile photo, generic name. We requested government ID verification. He never responded. Dodged a bullet.

---

### Step 2: Review History Analysis

**What we check:**
- ✅ 3+ positive reviews from different hosts
- ✅ Superguest status (Airbnb's equivalent of verified)
- ⚠️ Zero reviews (could be fine, needs extra checks)
- 🚨 Negative reviews mentioning noise, damage, or rule violations

**Green flag reviews we love seeing:**
- "Left the place spotless"
- "Great communication"
- "Respected all house rules"

**Red flag reviews that make us pause:**
- "Brought unauthorized guests"
- "Complained about everything"
- "Checkout was a mess"

**Pro tip:** We read between the lines. A review like "Guest was okay" (3 stars) often means problems the previous host didn't want to detail publicly.

---

### Step 3: Communication Style Assessment

**How guests message us tells us a lot:**

**GREEN FLAGS:**
- Polite, complete sentences
- Asks about check-in logistics
- Mentions the reason for visit (business trip, family vacation)
- Responds promptly to our questions

**RED FLAGS:**
- Demands special treatment before booking
- Asks about "parties" or "how many people can fit"
- Vague about who's staying
- Pushy about early check-in or late checkout
- Messages at 2am expecting instant replies

**Real example from Klebang:**
> Guest: "Can we bring 12 friends? Listing says max 6 but we're quiet."
> 
> Translation: They're planning a party. Booking rejected.

---

### Step 4: Booking Pattern Analysis

**Red flags in booking behavior:**

🚨 **Last-minute local bookings:**
- Malaysian guest books same-day for tonight
- Often indicates party plans or unauthorized use
- *Exception:* Business travelers with corporate accounts are usually fine

🚨 **Single-night weekend bookings:**
- Friday night only
- High risk of parties (especially around universities)
- We often require 2-night minimum for weekends

🚨 **Mismatched group size:**
- Books for 2 but asks about parking for 5 cars
- Clear sign of undeclared guests

✅ **Green flag bookings:**
- Family vacations (3-5 nights)
- Singapore long weekends (Fri-Mon)
- Advance bookings (2+ weeks notice)
- Corporate/business travel

---

### Step 5: Government ID Verification

For any booking that raises questions, we require:

**Mandatory verification:**
- Photo of government-issued ID (IC/Passport)
- Selfie holding the ID
- Confirmation of actual number of guests

**When we always require this:**
- New Airbnb accounts (no booking history)
- Large groups (6+ people)
- Local same-day bookings
- Any booking with 2+ red flags

**Why guests comply:**
Legitimate travelers understand this protects everyone. Problem guests disappear when you ask for ID.

## The Melaka Context: What We Watch For

Managing 100+ properties here, we've learned Melaka-specific patterns:

### **High-Risk Periods:**
1. **Chinese New Year (Jan/Feb)** — Party groups targeting Jonker area
2. **School Holidays** — Families are fine; groups of students need scrutiny
3. **Singapore Long Weekends** — Legitimate travel but higher volume
4. **Bachelor/Bachelorette Seasons** — Dec-Feb wedding season

### **High-Risk Locations:**
- **Jonker Walk area** — Tourist hotspot attracts party seekers
- **Klebang Beach** — Weekend party destination
- **Melaka Raya** — Business district, usually safe
- **Bukit Beruang** — Near universities, check student groups carefully

---

## Red Flags That Make Us Say "No"

We've rejected bookings for these reasons:

❌ Brand new Airbnb account + same-day local booking
❌ Guest claims solo traveler but asks about "space for 8 people"
❌ Previous negative reviews mentioning parties or damage
❌ Evasive when asked about trip purpose
❌ Refuses ID verification
❌ Demands special treatment before booking
❌ Messages from different person than account holder
❌ Asks about noise complaints from neighbors

**Result:** Our owners have had ZERO major property damage incidents in the past year. That's not luck — it's screening.

---

## What Happens When We Reject a Booking?

**Owner concern:** "Won't we lose income?"

**The reality:** One bad guest costs more than 10 missed bookings.

- Party damage: RM5,000+ repairs + lost bookings during repairs
- Smoking damage: RM3,000+ deep cleaning
- Theft: RM2,000+ replacement costs
- Negative reviews: 6 months of reduced bookings

We reject <5% of inquiries. That 5% would have caused 90% of your problems.

## DIY Screening Tips (If You're Self-Managing)

Can't afford full management yet? Here's how to protect yourself:

### **Minimum Screening Checklist:**
1. ✅ Require 3+ positive reviews (adjust for new guests)
2. ✅ Enable Airbnb's government ID verification
3. ✅ Read previous host reviews carefully
4. ✅ Message every guest before approving
5. ✅ Set strict house rules (no parties, no smoking, max occupancy)
6. ✅ Require 2-night minimum on weekends
7. ✅ Use exterior security cameras (disclosure required)

### **Airbnb Settings to Enable:**
- **Instant Book OFF** (manually approve each booking)
- **Government ID required** (Airbnb setting)
- **Minimum age 21+** (reduces party risk)
- **Reviews required** (you can make exceptions for verified business travelers)

### **Message Template:**
> "Hi [Name], thanks for your interest in our Melaka property! Quick questions before I approve:
> 
> 1. What brings you to Melaka?
> 2. Will it be just you, or are others joining?
> 3. Any special requests for check-in?
> 
> Looking forward to hosting you!"

**What this does:**
- Forces communication (bots/scammers don't reply)
- Reveals actual group size
- Sets friendly but professional tone

## The iHousing Advantage

**What we do that self-managers can't:**

✅ **24/7 monitoring** — We see booking attempts at 2am when you're asleep
✅ **Pattern recognition** — Managing 100+ properties shows us trends you'd miss
✅ **Blacklist database** — We track problem guests across our properties
✅ **Instant response** — We reply within 5 minutes (Airbnb rewards fast replies with higher rankings)
✅ **Local knowledge** — We know which Singapore holidays attract party groups
✅ **Legal backup** — If something goes wrong, we handle police reports and insurance claims

**Real numbers:**
- Average owner: Deals with 1-2 problem guests per year
- iHousing-managed properties: <0.1 problem guests per year (1 in 1,000 stays)

## What Property Damage Actually Costs You

Let's be specific about what we're protecting you from:

| Damage Type | Typical Cost | Time Lost |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Party damage (broken furniture, stains) | RM3,000-RM8,000 | 1-2 weeks |
| Smoking damage (odor removal) | RM2,500-RM4,000 | 3-5 days |
| Unauthorized pet damage | RM1,500-RM5,000 | 1 week |
| Theft (TV, furnishings) | RM2,000-RM6,000 | Immediate |
| Neighbor complaints → JMB ban | Priceless | Permanent loss |

**The math:**
- One bad guest: -RM5,000 average
- iHousing flat fee: RM250/month
- Screening alone pays for itself if it prevents one incident every 20 months

## Common Questions About Guest Screening

### **"Isn't this discriminatory?"**

No. We screen for behavior patterns, not personal characteristics. Anyone with:
- Positive reviews
- Verified ID
- Respectful communication
- Legitimate travel purpose

...gets approved regardless of nationality, age (over 21), or background.

### **"What if someone with zero reviews wants to book?"

We evaluate case-by-case:
- Business traveler with corporate email? Usually fine (we verify)
- Family vacation with government ID? Fine with deposit
- Local last-minute booking with no profile details? Rejected

### **"Do you ever make mistakes?"**

Occasionally we approve someone who turns out to be difficult. But we've never approved someone who caused serious property damage. That's the difference.

## The Bottom Line

**Guest screening isn't about saying "no" to everyone.**

It's about saying "yes" to the 95% of wonderful guests while protecting your RM400,000+ investment from the 5% who'd trash it.

You worked hard for that Melaka property. Don't gamble with it.
