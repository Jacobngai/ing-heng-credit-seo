**Key Insight:** By focusing 100% on Melaka instead of Malaysia, we go from competing in a 9,900/month keyword ("airbnb malaysia") with HIGH competition... to DOMINATING dozens of 20-100/month Melaka-specific keywords with ZERO competition.

**Strategic Question:** Should we position iHousing as "Melaka's #1 Airbnb Management Company" rather than "another Malaysia company"?
