# Competitor Analysis (Melaka-Focused)
**Client:** iHousing (Airbnb Property Management - Melaka)
**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting Employee Review

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Melaka Opportunity is MASSIVE:**

Based on comprehensive research, here's what we discovered:

1. **No Melaka-Focused Competitor:** Every competitor focuses on KL/Penang. Melaka is a greenfield.

2. **20-30% Commission is Industry Standard:** Research shows competitors charge 20-30% commission. Our flat fee (RM200-300) is a MASSIVE differentiator.

3. **Zero Competition on Our USP:** Keywords like "flat fee airbnb management melaka" have ZERO competition.

4. **Market Data Supports the Opportunity:**
   - Melaka Airbnb revenue: RM7,215-9,174/year average
   - Occupancy: 19-22% (room for growth)
   - Weekend from KL: 2-hour drive = major tourist source
   - 1.9 million unoccupied homes in Malaysia = huge problem-aware audience

**Strategic Conclusion:** We can dominate Melaka Airbnb SEO within 12 months by:
- Focusing 100% on Melaka (not Malaysia-wide)
- Owning "flat fee" keywords (zero competition)
- Creating problem-aware content (empty condos, tenant issues)
- Building condo-specific pages (10 condos = zero competition each)
