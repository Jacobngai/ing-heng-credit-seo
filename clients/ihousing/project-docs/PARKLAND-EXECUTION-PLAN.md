## Airbnb Income Estimates (Conservative)

Based on Melaka market research:

| Unit Type | Est. Nightly Rate | Monthly Income* | Annual Income |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Type A (635 sqft, 1+1) | RM150-180 | RM4,500-5,400 | RM54,000-64,800 |
| Type B (796 sqft, 2) | RM180-220 | RM5,400-6,600 | RM64,800-79,200 |
| Type C (972 sqft, 3) | RM220-280 | RM6,600-8,400 | RM79,200-100,800 |
| Type D (818 sqft, 2) | RM200-250 | RM6,000-7,500 | RM72,000-90,000 |

---

## ROI Calculation Formula

**Monthly Net Income = Monthly Airbnb Income - iHousing Fee**

**Annual Net Income = Monthly Net Income × 12**

**ROI % = (Annual Net Income / Down Payment) × 100**

**Example (Type B with 70% occupancy):**
- Monthly Income: RM5,400
- iHousing Fee: RM250
- Monthly Net: RM5,150
- Annual Net: RM61,800
- If Down Payment: RM200,000
- **ROI: (RM61,800 / RM200,000) × 100 = 30.9% annual ROI**

## Important Notes

1. **Clear Separation:** Investment pages target NEW investors. Owner pages target EXISTING owners. NEVER mix these in one page.

2. **Flat Fee USP:** Emphasize RM200-300/month flat fee vs RM800-1,000/month (20% commission). This is the main differentiator.

3. **Official Badge:** Mention "Parkland Group" and "Official Project" throughout to build credibility.

4. **WhatsApp Integration:** Forms need backend + Evolution API. Start with placeholder forms, integrate API when ready.

5. **ROI Calculator:** Must be fully functional JavaScript with real-time calculations.

6. **Images:** Use official Parkland Group images only - no stock photos for the project itself.

7. **Conservative Estimates:** Use RM150-300/night range for Airbnb rates to remain realistic.

8. **Internal Linking:** Cross-link to main iHousing content (Investment Guides, For Owners section, About, Contact).

9. **SEO Priority:** Parkland pages get 0.95 priority - second only to homepage variants (1.0).

10. **Zero 404 Policy:** Always update SLUG_MANIFEST.json when adding/deleting pages.
