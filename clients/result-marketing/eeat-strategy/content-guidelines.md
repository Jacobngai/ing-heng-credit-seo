# Result Marketing - E-E-A-T Content Guidelines

**Date Created:** 2025-11-10
**Purpose:** Ensure all content demonstrates Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness
**Audience:** Content creators, Walter (founder), Sarah (strategist), guest contributors

---

## What is E-E-A-T?

**E-E-A-T** stands for:
- **Experience:** First-hand or life experience with the topic
- **Expertise:** Knowledge, qualifications, and skills
- **Authoritativeness:** Recognition as a go-to source
- **Trustworthiness:** Accuracy, transparency, and legitimacy

Google and AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) prioritize content that demonstrates E-E-A-T, especially for topics that impact people's lives (YMYL - Your Money, Your Life).

**Why it matters for Result Marketing:**
- SEO is a YMYL topic (impacts business decisions and revenue)
- We're a new brand with no authority yet - must build through content
- AI search engines are even MORE focused on E-E-A-T (they want reliable sources to cite)

## E-E-A-T Requirements by Content Type

### Blog Articles (Technical SEO, Tutorials, Guides)

**Required E-E-A-T Elements:**
1. **Author byline:** Clear attribution (Walter Chen or Sarah Tan)
2. **First-hand experience:** Use "I built...", "In my experience...", "When I worked with..."
3. **Specific examples:** Screenshots, code samples, real project details
4. **Transparent methodology:** Explain exactly what you did and why
5. **Citations:** Link to authoritative sources (Google documentation, studies, tools)
6. **Updated date:** Show content is current
7. **Author bio:** Include at end of article with credentials

**Example of GOOD E-E-A-T:**
> "Last month, I deployed a multi-language SEO site for Ing Heng Credit using Astro and Vercel. The site went from 0 to 250 indexed keywords in 60 days. Here's exactly how I did it..." [Includes screenshots, code samples, metrics]

**Example of BAD E-E-A-T (avoid):**
> "Multi-language SEO is important for businesses. Many companies use it to rank better. You should consider implementing it." [Vague, no experience, no specifics]

---

### Case Studies

**Required E-E-A-T Elements:**
1. **Client attribution:** Name the client (with permission) or anonymize clearly

4. **Methodology:** What tactics did you use?
5. **Client testimonial:** Direct quote from the client
6. **Visual proof:** Screenshots, graphs, analytics data

### Industry-Specific Guides (SaaS, E-commerce, Professional Services)

**Required E-E-A-T Elements:**
1. **Industry experience:** Have you worked with this industry? Mention specific clients (anonymized if needed)
2. **Industry-specific challenges:** Show you understand unique pain points
3. **Relevant examples:** Use industry terminology and scenarios
4. **Data/statistics:** Cite industry reports, studies
5. **Expert quotes:** Include perspectives from industry insiders (if available)

**Example of GOOD E-E-A-T:**
> "I've worked with 3 SaaS companies in Malaysia to scale their SEO. The biggest challenge I've seen is explaining complex technical features in simple terms. For example, one client's 'API rate limiting' feature confused searchers. We reframed it as 'protect your app from overload' and created 15 related keywords that converted better."

**Example of BAD E-E-A-T (avoid):**
> "SaaS companies need SEO. Here are some tips that might work for SaaS businesses..." [Generic, no experience, no specifics]

### Strategy & Opinion Pieces

5. **Transparency:** Disclose any biases or conflicts of interest

**Example of GOOD E-E-A-T:**
> "I believe AI search will overtake traditional Google search by 2027. Here's why: I've tracked 50 client websites over 6 months, and ChatGPT citations are growing 30% month-over-month while Google organic traffic is flat. That said, Google still dominates for transactional queries, so businesses need both strategies."

## Writing with Experience (The "E")

### Use First-Person Perspective

**✅ DO:**
- "I built..."
- "In my experience..."
- "When I worked with [Client]..."
- "I've tested this approach on 10 websites..."
- "Here's what I learned..."

**❌ DON'T:**
- "One should consider..."
- "It is recommended that..."
- "Many experts believe..."
- "Studies show..." (without citing specific study)

### Show, Don't Just Tell

**✅ DO:**
Include specific details that prove you've done this:
- Screenshots from real projects
- Code samples from actual implementations
- Metrics from real campaigns
- Client quotes and testimonials
- Behind-the-scenes photos/videos

**❌ DON'T:**
Make vague claims without proof:
- "This strategy works well" (no data)
- "We help businesses grow" (no specifics)
- "Results may vary" (cop-out language)

### Be Specific with Numbers

**✅ DO:**
- "250 indexed keywords in 60 days"
- "Reduced cost per lead from RM500 to RM180"
- "Generated 15 qualified leads in the first month"
- "Implemented 12 long-tail keyword clusters"

**❌ DON'T:**
- "Lots of keywords"
- "Significant cost reduction"
- "Many leads"
- "Multiple keyword opportunities"

---

## Writing with Expertise (The "E")

### Demonstrate Technical Knowledge

**✅ DO:**
Explain the "why" behind tactics:
- "I use Astro because it generates static HTML, which loads faster and ranks better than client-side frameworks like React or Vue."
- "I optimize for AI search by using conversational headers, natural language, and comprehensive answers - not keyword stuffing."

**❌ DON'T:**
Just say what to do without explaining why:
- "Use Astro for SEO."
- "Optimize for AI search."

### Use Proper Terminology

**✅ DO:**
Use industry-standard terms correctly:
- "Structured data (schema markup)"
- "Canonical tags prevent duplicate content issues"
- "Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)"

**❌ DON'T:**
Use vague or incorrect terms:
- "Meta tags make your site faster" (wrong)
- "SEO juice" (unprofessional)
- "Black hat SEO tricks" (avoid promoting bad practices)

### Cite Authoritative Sources

**✅ DO:**
Link to credible sources:
- Google Search Central documentation
- Studies from reputable organizations (Moz, Ahrefs, Search Engine Journal)
- Official tool documentation
- Industry reports with data

**❌ DON'T:**
Make unsupported claims:
- "Google confirmed that..." (without linking to source)
- "Studies show..." (without citing specific study)
- "Experts agree..." (without naming experts)

---

## Writing with Authoritativeness (The "A")

### Position as an Authority

**✅ DO:**
Reference your track record:
- "I've deployed 20+ SEO websites over the past 5 years..."
- "After working with 10+ SaaS clients, I've learned..."
- "Based on my experience managing 5,000+ keywords across 15 industries..."

**❌ DON'T:**
Make empty claims:
- "We're the best SEO agency in Malaysia" (no proof)
- "Trust us, we know what we're doing" (vague)

### Reference Your Published Work

**✅ DO:**
Link to your own content:
- "As I explained in my article on [topic]..."
- "I covered this in detail in my case study on [client]..."
- "Related reading: [link to your other article]"

**❌ DON'T:**
Act like every article is your first:
- Write as if you've never discussed SEO before
- Fail to build on previous content

### Showcase Credentials

**✅ DO:**
Mention relevant qualifications (naturally, not forced):
- "As a Google Analytics Certified professional..."
- "With a background in software development, I understand..."
- "During my 5 years doing SEO for financial services..."

**❌ DON'T:**
Overdo it or lie:
- "As the world's leading AI SEO expert..." (unverifiable)
- List irrelevant credentials (e.g., "Certified yoga instructor" in SEO article)

---

## Writing with Trustworthiness (The "T")

### Be Transparent

**✅ DO:**
Acknowledge limitations:
- "This strategy works best for B2B SaaS. E-commerce sites may need a different approach."
- "Results took 60 days. If you need faster results, consider paid ads."
- "I use Claude AI to draft content, but I review and edit every article."

**❌ DON'T:**
Over-promise or hide flaws:
- "This works for every business!" (unrealistic)
- "See results in 24 hours!" (misleading)
- Pretend AI content is 100% human-written (dishonest)

### Admit Mistakes

**✅ DO:**
Share lessons learned from failures:
- "I initially tried [approach] but it didn't work because..."
- "Here's what I'd do differently next time..."
- "This case study shows what NOT to do..."

**❌ DON'T:**
Pretend you're always right:
- Only share successes, never failures
- Blame clients when strategies fail

### Disclose Conflicts of Interest

**✅ DO:**
Be upfront about affiliations:
- "Full disclosure: I'm a Vercel user and partner."
- "This client paid for our services and gave permission to share their story."
- "I use Claude Code daily and may be biased toward AI automation."

**❌ DON'T:**
Hide relationships:
- Promote tools without disclosing you're a partner/affiliate
- Feature clients without mentioning they paid you

### Update Content Regularly

**✅ DO:**
Keep content current:
- Add "Last updated: [date]" at the top of articles
- Review and refresh content every 6-12 months
- Add editor's notes for significant updates: "Update 2026: This strategy still works, but..."

**❌ DON'T:**
Let content become outdated:
- Reference old data without noting it's old
- Leave broken links or outdated information

### ✅ DO Use AI For:

- Making up statistics or case studies
- Writing about topics where you have no real experience

2. **Human adds experience** (Walter/Sarah add personal insights, case studies, screenshots)
3. **Human verifies facts** (check all claims, data, links)
4. **Human edits for voice** (ensure it sounds like Walter or Sarah, not generic AI)
5. **Human adds E-E-A-T elements** (byline, author bio, credentials, visual proof)

**Transparency:**
- We're open about using AI tools
- Every article has human oversight and editing
- We add unique insights AI can't provide (our experience)
