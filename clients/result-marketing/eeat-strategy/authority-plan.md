3. **Transparent case studies** (show our work publicly)
4. **Community building** (educate, don't just sell)

## Authority Building Principles

### 1. Teach, Don't Just Sell
- Share our methodology openly (transparency builds trust)
- Create educational content that helps even non-clients
- Focus on industry education, not just self-promotion

### 2. Show, Don't Just Tell
- Behind-the-scenes content showing our actual process
- Real case studies with specific metrics (not vague claims)
- Video demos of tools and workflows

### 3. Be Specific, Not Generic
- "100 keywords/month" vs. "we do SEO"
- "AI search optimization" vs. "digital marketing"
- "Claude Code + Astro" vs. "modern tech stack"

### 4. Consistency Over Perfection
- Better to publish 5 good articles per week than 1 perfect article per month
- Regular LinkedIn posting builds momentum
- Show up daily, even if content isn't perfect

### 5. Leverage Early Mover Advantage
- AI search is new territory - we can own this category
- Traditional agencies are slow to adapt - we move fast
- Position as "future of SEO" not "alternative to traditional SEO"
