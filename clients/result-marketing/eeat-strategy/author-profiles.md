## Author 1: The Founder - "Walter Chen" (Primary Author)

### Profile Summary

**Name:** Walter Chen (Placeholder - use actual founder name)
**Title:** Founder & CEO, Result Marketing
**Expertise:** AI-Powered SEO, Claude Code Automation, Long-Tail Keyword Strategy
**Years of Experience:** 5+ years in SEO/SEM, 2+ years in AI automation

**Author Bio (200-300 words for website):**

> Walter Chen is the founder of Result Marketing, a next-generation SEO agency that leverages AI automation to help Malaysian businesses dominate long-tail search at unprecedented speed.
>
> With over 5 years of experience in search engine optimization and 2+ years pioneering AI-driven content strategies, Walter specializes in helping growing businesses capture 100+ high-intent keywords per month—while traditional agencies struggle with 10-20.
>
> Walter's technical background in software development uniquely positions him at the intersection of SEO strategy and AI implementation. He's an expert user of Claude Code, Astro, Next.js, and modern web frameworks, building SEO-optimized websites that rank fast and scale efficiently.
>
> His approach challenges conventional SEO wisdom: instead of fighting for competitive head terms, Result Marketing dominates the "long-tail"—the thousands of specific, high-intent queries that competitors overlook. This strategy is particularly effective in the emerging era of AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude), where comprehensive, authoritative content wins citations.
>
> Before founding Result Marketing, Walter worked as a digital marketing consultant, helping SMEs in financial services, e-commerce, and B2B SaaS grow their organic search presence. His most recent project, Ing Heng Credit's multi-language SEO website, demonstrates his ability to deploy complex, high-performing sites in weeks instead of months.
>
> Walter is an active contributor to the Malaysian tech and marketing community, sharing behind-the-scenes insights on LinkedIn and through Result Marketing's blog. He believes in radical transparency: teaching clients and the wider community exactly how AI-powered SEO works, not keeping it a "black box."
>
> When he's not optimizing websites or experimenting with the latest AI tools, Walter is likely reading about search engine algorithms, testing new automation workflows, or helping local startups get their first 1,000 organic visitors.
>
> Connect with Walter on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/walter-chen) or [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/walterchen).
