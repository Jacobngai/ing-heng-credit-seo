## Cross-Hub Linking Strategy

### Hub-to-Hub Linking

Each hub should link to related hubs where contextually appropriate:

**Example:**
- **AI Search Hub** → Links to **Long-Tail Hub** ("AI search optimization works best with long-tail keyword strategy...")
- **Long-Tail Hub** → Links to **SaaS Hub** ("SaaS companies benefit most from 100+ long-tail keywords...")
- **SaaS Hub** → Links to **AI Search Hub** ("Modern SaaS companies should optimize for both Google and AI search...")

### Spoke-to-Hub-to-Spoke Linking

**Pattern:**
1. User lands on **Spoke Article** (e.g., "ChatGPT Optimization")
2. Article links to **Hub** (e.g., "AI Search Optimization Guide") 2-3 times
3. User may navigate to Hub, then discover other **Related Spokes**
4. Spoke also links to **1-2 related sibling spokes** directly

**Internal Linking Rules:**
- Every spoke must link to its hub **at least 2 times** (contextually)
- Every spoke should link to **1-2 related spokes** (sibling articles)
- Hub should link to **all spokes** in a "Related Articles" section
- Use **descriptive anchor text** (not "click here")

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1)
1. Create **Hub 1 (AI Search)** page
2. Create **top 5 Spoke articles** for Hub 1
3. Create **Hub 2 (Long-Tail)** page
4. Create **top 5 Spoke articles** for Hub 2

### Phase 2: Vertical Hubs (Month 2-3)
1. Create **Hub 3A (SaaS)** + 5 spokes
2. Create **Hub 3B (Professional Services)** + 5 spokes
3. Create **Hub 3C (Equipment Financing)** + 5 spokes

### Phase 3: Scale Spokes (Month 4-6)
1. Complete all remaining spokes for Hubs 1-2
2. Complete all remaining spokes for Hub 3A-3C
3. Create **Hub 3D (E-commerce)** + spokes
4. Create **Hub 3E (Small Business)** + spokes

---

## Maintenance and Expansion

### Quarterly Hub Review

3. **Check internal links** (fix broken links)
4. **Analyze performance** (rankings, traffic, conversions)
5. **Refresh content** (add new sections, update outdated info)

### Annual Hub Expansion
Each year:
1. **Create 1-2 new hubs** for emerging topics
