## Why CPC Varies by Industry

### Factor 1: Customer Lifetime Value

Google's auction considers how much a customer is worth.

**High LTV industries = higher CPC:**
- Construction equipment rental (RM50,000-200,000 per contract)
- Emergency services (RM500-5,000 per job)
- Vehicle rental (RM10,000-100,000 per contract)

**Lower LTV industries = lower CPC:**
- Cleaning services (RM200-800 per job)
- Basic home repairs (RM300-1,500 per job)

### Factor 2: Urgency

Urgent needs = higher CPC.

**Emergency keywords ("emergency", "24 hour"):**
- Immediate need
- Less price-sensitive
- Higher conversion (20-40%)
- **Higher CPC: RM15-25**

**Non-emergency keywords:**
- Planned purchase
- Price-sensitive
- Lower conversion (5-15%)
- **Lower CPC: RM5-12**

### Factor 3: Competition

More advertisers bidding = higher CPC.

**High competition industries:**
- Construction equipment (lots of rental companies)
- Emergency services (many service providers)
- Vehicle services (established market)

**Lower competition industries:**
- Specialized services (niche markets)
- New service types (emerging markets)

## Cost Per Lead Calculator

Let's calculate actual cost per lead for different industries.

**Formula:**
CPC ÷ Lead Conversion Rate = Cost Per Lead (CPL)

**Example 1: Emergency Plumber**
- CPC: RM20
- Lead conversion: 30% (high intent "emergency")
- **CPL: RM67**

**Example 2: Crane Rental**
- CPC: RM15
- Lead conversion: 15% (considered purchase)
- **CPL: RM100**

**Example 3: House Cleaning**
- CPC: RM6
- Lead conversion: 10% (lower urgency)
- **CPL: RM60**

### Monthly Budget Comparison

**To generate 50 leads/month:**

| Industry | CPC | Conv % | CPL | Monthly Budget |

| Car Workshop | RM8 | 12% | RM67 | RM3,350 |

## When to Use Google Ads vs SEO

### Google Ads = Fast Results, High Cost

**Use Google Ads if:**
- You need leads immediately (this week)
- You have the budget (RM3,000-10,000/month)
- You're in a highly competitive industry
- You want to test a new market quickly

**Advantages:**
- Results in days
- Precise geographic targeting
- Easy to track ROI
- Can pause anytime

**Disadvantages:**
- Rising CPC (10-15% yearly increase)
- Stop paying = zero leads
- No long-term equity
- Expensive for high-competition keywords

### SEO = Slower Results, Lower Cost

**Use SEO if:**
- You can wait 3-6 months for results
- You want predictable, fixed costs
- You want to build long-term equity
- You want sustainable growth

**Advantages:**
- Fixed cost (RM1,200/month)
- Compounding returns (more leads over time)
- Build equity (you own the rankings)
- 3-10x lower cost per lead long-term

**Disadvantages:**
- Takes 3-6 months to see results
- Requires patience
- Can't pause without losing progress

### The Hybrid Strategy (Recommended)

**Months 1-3:**
- Google Ads: RM3,000-6,000/month (immediate leads)
- SEO: RM1,200/month (building foundations)
- Total: RM4,200-7,200/month

**Months 4-6:**
- Google Ads: RM2,000-4,000/month (scaling down)
- SEO: RM1,200/month (starting to generate leads)
- Total: RM3,200-5,200/month

**Months 7-12:**
- Google Ads: RM1,000-2,000/month (minimal)
- SEO: RM1,200/month (generating 80-250 leads/month)
- Total: RM2,200-3,200/month

**Year 2+:**
- Google Ads: RM0-1,000/month (special promotions only)
- SEO: RM1,200/month (maximum results)
- Total: RM1,200-2,200/month

**Result: By month 12, you're generating the same or more leads for 50-70% less cost.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's a "good" CPC for my industry?**
A: Look at industry benchmarks above. If you're paying 20-30% more than average, your ads need optimization (quality score, landing page, targeting).

**Q: Why is my CPC higher than the benchmarks?**
A: Possible reasons: low Quality Score (improve ad relevance), poor landing page experience, narrow geographic targeting, or highly competitive keywords.

**Q: Should I use Google Ads or SEO for a new business?**
A: Use both initially. Google Ads for immediate cash flow, SEO for long-term growth. Scale back Google Ads as SEO ramps up.

**Q: Can I rank #1 organically AND run Google Ads?**
A: Yes, and you should. Studies show ranking organically + running ads increases total click-through rate by 50%+.

**Q: What's Quality Score and why does it matter?**
A: Google's rating (1-10) of your ad quality. Higher Quality Score = lower CPC. Improve by: better ad relevance, higher CTR, better landing page experience.
