## **Direct Answer: Which Industries Win with AEO?**

Construction equipment rental and emergency services see highest AEO returns (7,500% and 2,500% ROI respectively) due to high-intent, urgent searches. Local services (plumbers, HVAC, locksmiths) achieve consistent 4,500-6,000% ROI within 90 days. B2B industries experience longer sales cycles (4-6 months) but generate larger deal sizes, resulting in 2,000-3,000% ROI. Retail and e-commerce see moderate 1,500-2,500% ROI due to lower average order values. Key success factor: industries where customers ask "how much", "how to", "where to find" questions see fastest AEO traction.

**Remember: Every industry sees positive AEO ROI. The question is how much and how fast.**

Question: **What's your industry's potential?**

---

## **FAQ: Industry AEO Performance**

### **Which industry has the highest AEO ROI?**

Construction equipment rental at 7,500% ROI (6 months) and equipment rental franchise at 8,567% ROI (12 months). High ticket sizes + urgent searches + multi-location compounding create perfect conditions.

### **What if my industry isn't listed?**

Contact us for custom analysis. AEO principles work universally for any business where customers ask questions. The core requirement: query-based searches, not just product name searches.

### **Do B2B companies really see lower ROI?**

Lower percentage ROI but higher absolute revenue. B2B manufacturing's 2,300% ROI generated RM536,000 vs emergency services' 2,500% ROI generating RM214,400. B2B wins on total revenue.

### **How does local vs national affect ROI?**

Local businesses see faster ROI (45-90 days) due to location-specific AI citations. National businesses take longer (90-150 days) but can scale citations across more queries. Both achieve strong long-term returns.

### **Can e-commerce really succeed with AEO?**

Yes, but focus on research and comparison queries, not product name searches. "Best laptop for students" triggers AI Overviews. "Buy MacBook Pro" doesn't. Shift strategy to decision-stage content.
