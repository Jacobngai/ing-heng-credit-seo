## What is AEO ROI?

**AEO ROI (Answer Engine Optimization Return on Investment)** measures how much revenue you generate from appearing in AI answers (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Copilot, Perplexity) compared to your investment.

**Simple definition:**
- **Investment:** RM1,200/month (typical AEO retainer)
- **Revenue:** Leads/calls from people who saw you in AI answers
- **ROI:** Percentage return on that RM1,200

**The difference from traditional SEO:**
- Traditional SEO tracks clicks (people visiting your site)
- AEO tracks **impressions + conversions** (people seeing you in AI answers without clicking)

**Why this matters in 2026:**
Google AI Overviews now appear in 45% of search results. Zero-click searches don't mean zero revenue. You're getting brand visibility and leads that never touch your website.

## The AEO ROI Formula

**Basic Formula:**
```
AEO ROI = (Revenue from AEO leads - AEO investment) ÷ AEO investment × 100
```

**Example:**
- AEO investment: RM1,200/month
- Revenue from AEO leads: RM4,800/month (4 closed deals × RM1,200 each)
- ROI = (4,800 - 1,200) ÷ 1,200 × 100 = **300%**

**The Complete Formula (includes all costs):**
```
AEO ROI = (Total revenue from AEO sources - Total AEO costs) ÷ Total AEO costs × 100

Total AEO costs = AEO retainer + Content production + Tools + Your time
```

**Typical Malaysian SME breakdown:**
- AEO retainer: RM1,200/month
- Content production: RM0 (included in retainer)
- Tools (Schema generators, AI writing): RM0 (agency provides)
- Your time (reviewing reports): 2 hours/month = RM200 (if your time = RM100/hour)
- **Total AEO cost: RM1,400/month**

---

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### Step 1: Track Your AEO Investment

**Fixed costs (monthly):**
- [ ] AEO agency retainer: RM______
- [ ] Tools/software: RM______
- [ ] Content production: RM______
- [ ] Your time (hours × hourly rate): RM______
- **Total Monthly Investment: RM______**

**Example:**
RM1,200 (agency) + RM200 (your time) = **RM1,400/month**

---

### Step 2: Identify AEO-Generated Leads

**The challenge:** AI answer traffic doesn't always show in Google Analytics.

**Workaround: Ask every new lead:**
> "How did you hear about us?"

**AEO indicators:**
- They say "I saw you in Google's AI answer"
- They mention specific information that ONLY appears in AI Overviews
- They know your brand but never visited your site before
- They found you via ChatGPT/Copilot referral

**Track in a simple spreadsheet:**
| Lead Date | Source | Revenue | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|
| 2026-01-15 | AI Overview | RM1,500 | Asked about "crane rental pricing" |
| 2026-01-18 | ChatGPT | RM2,100 | Copilot recommended us |
| 2026-01-22 | Google AI | RM800 | Saw comparison table |

---

### Step 3: Calculate Revenue from AEO Leads

**Formula:**
```
Total AEO revenue = (Number of AEO leads × Conversion rate) × Average deal value
```

**Example (Crane rental business):**
- AEO-generated leads: 20/month
- Conversion rate: 25% (close 5 deals)
- Average rental value: RM1,500/month contract
- **Revenue:** 20 × 25% × RM1,500 = **RM7,500/month**

**Example (Locksmith business):**
- AEO-generated calls: 60/month
- Conversion rate: 40% (24 jobs)
- Average job value: RM250 (emergency call-out)
- **Revenue:** 60 × 40% × RM250 = **RM6,000/month**

---

### Step 4: Calculate ROI

**Final calculation:**
```
ROI = (Revenue - Investment) ÷ Investment × 100
```

**Crane rental example:**
- Revenue: RM7,500
- Investment: RM1,400
- ROI = (7,500 - 1,400) ÷ 1,400 × 100 = **436%**

**Locksmith example:**
- Revenue: RM6,000
- Investment: RM1,400
- ROI = (6,000 - 1,400) ÷ 1,400 × 100 = **329%**

## Why Most Businesses Calculate Wrong

### Mistake 1: Only Tracking Website Traffic

**Wrong approach:**
"We only got 50 clicks from AI Overviews, so AEO doesn't work."

**Reality:**
- 1,000 people saw your brand in AI answers
- 50 clicked your website
- 150 called you directly (saw your phone number in the AI answer)
- 800 remembered your brand for later

**You're missing 90% of the impact.**

---

### Mistake 2: Not Asking "How Did You Hear About Us?"

**If you don't ask, you'll never know:**
- 30-40% of leads say "I found you in Google's AI answer" when prompted
- Most businesses never ask, so they credit "referral" or "word of mouth"

**Simple fix:**
Train your staff to ask EVERY new customer:
> "Before we start, how did you find out about us? We track our marketing."

---

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Example:**
- First job: RM250 (locksmith emergency call)
- Customer books annual maintenance: RM1,200/year
- Refers 2 friends: RM500/year

**Total LTV: RM1,950 from one AEO-generated lead**

**Most businesses calculate ROI on first transaction only.**
They underestimate ROI by 3-5x.

## AEO ROI Calculator

**Use this simple spreadsheet:**

| Month | AEO Investment | AEO Leads | Converted Deals | Revenue | ROI |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------|-----|
| Month 1 | RM1,200 | 5 | 1 | RM500 | -58% |
| Month 3 | RM1,200 | 20 | 6 | RM3,600 | 200% |
| Month 6 | RM1,200 | 45 | 15 | RM9,000 | 650% |
| Month 12 | RM1,200 | 80 | 28 | RM16,800 | 1,300% |

**The compound effect:**
- Month 1-3: Build phase (negative or low ROI)
- Month 3-6: Growth phase (200-500% ROI)
- Month 6-12: Scale phase (500%+ ROI)

**Most businesses quit at Month 2.** They miss the exponential curve.

## **FAQ: AEO ROI Calculation**

### **How long does it take to see positive AEO ROI?**

Most businesses see positive ROI by Month 3-4. The first 2 months are investment-heavy (schema setup, content creation, earning citations). By Month 6, typical ROI is 300-600%. The key is tracking leads from AI answers accurately.

### **What's a good AEO ROI benchmark?**

**Healthy benchmarks by industry:**
- Emergency services (locksmith, plumber): 200-400% ROI by Month 3
- High-ticket services (construction, equipment rental): 400-800% ROI by Month 6
- Local service businesses (aircond, cleaning): 150-300% ROI by Month 4

Anything below 100% ROI by Month 6 means your AEO strategy needs adjustment (wrong keywords, poor conversion rate, weak schema).

### **Do I need expensive tools to calculate AEO ROI?**

No. You need:
1. Google Search Console (free) - track AI Overview impressions
2. A simple lead tracking spreadsheet (Excel/Google Sheets)
3. Consistent "how did you hear about us?"询问 with every lead

Most expensive ROI tools overcomplicate it. Focus on revenue, not vanity metrics.

### **What if my AEO ROI is negative after 6 months?**

**Common causes:**
1. **Wrong keywords:** Targeting low-intent searches
2. **Poor conversion:** Your business isn't closing leads well
3. **Weak schema:** Your content isn't optimized for AI answers
4. **Low search volume:** Your niche doesn't have enough AI search traffic

**Solution:** Audit your AEO strategy or switch to Google Ads (higher cost, faster results).

### **How does AEO ROI compare to Facebook Ads ROI?**

**Typical comparison (Malaysian SME data):**
- **Facebook Ads:** 120-180% ROI (but costs increase every year)
- **Google Ads:** 150-250% ROI (high competition in 2026)
- **AEO:** 300-800% ROI (compounds over 12+ months)

The key difference: AEO is an **asset** (you own the rankings), ads are **rent** (you disappear when you stop paying).
