## **How Local AI Search Works**

### The Local AI Search Process

**User asks:** "Plumber near me" or "SEO agency in Kuala Lumpur"

**AI engine process:**

1. **Detect location intent**
   - Keywords: "near me", "in [city]", "[city] [service]"
   - User's location (if permission granted)

2. **Scan local data sources**
   - Google Business Profile listings
   - Local directories (Yelp, Fave, etc.)
   - Websites with LocalBusiness schema
   - Review platforms

3. **Evaluate local authority**
   - Proximity to searcher
   - Review count and rating
   - Business category relevance
   - Local citations (mentions)

4. **Generate local recommendations**
   - Cite 3-5 local businesses
   - Include ratings, location, contact info
   - Provide reasoning for recommendations

### Why Local AIEO Matters

**Statistics:**
- 46% of Google searches have local intent
- 88% of local searches result in a call or visit within 24 hours
- Local AI recommendations have 40% higher conversion than general search

**The opportunity:**
- Local AI search is less competitive than general search
- Fewer businesses optimize for local AIEO
- Higher conversion rates (local intent = ready to buy)
