- "Pause anytime" (no lock-in fear)

**Step 3:** Easy sign-up

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### How long does cleaning service SEO take?

**2-3 months** for local keywords like "cleaning service [your area]". Commercial cleaning keywords take **3-5 months** (higher competition, higher value). Residential cleaning keywords rank fastest.

### Should I target residential or commercial cleaning?

**Both.** Create separate pages on your website. Commercial has higher value per contract. Residential has more volume. Diversify for stability - commercial as income base, residential for cash flow.

### Can I rank for cleaning keywords in multiple languages?

**Absolutely.** 40% of Malaysians prefer searching in Malay or Chinese. We create content in EN/ZH/MS. Your website automatically serves the right language based on user preference.

### Do I need to show exact pricing on my website?

**Use ranges.** Every property is different size/condition. Show ranges (e.g., "RM400-600/month for weekly house cleaning") to set expectations without over-promising. Exact quotes after site visit or phone assessment.
