## **Van Rental SEO vs Competitors**

**Your competitors:**
- Big van rental companies (Mayflower, Hertz) - expensive, rigid contracts
- Small players - outranking you with SEO
- Peer-to-peer platforms (SOCAR) - different model, still competition

**Every day you wait:**
- 30+ delivery businesses search for van rentals in your area
- Your competitors get those contracts
- You lose RM15,000-50,000 lifetime value per customer

**Example opportunity:**
"van rental with driver" = 400+ searches/month
Average contract value: RM5,000/month
If you capture 10% of market: 40 contracts × RM5,000 = RM200,000/month revenue

**Cost to rank:**
- Google Ads: RM5 CPC × 400 searches = RM2,000/month for 10% share
- SEO: RM1,200/month for top 3 rankings

**ROI calculation:**
- SEO cost: RM14,400/year
- Revenue (10% share): RM200,000/month × 12 = RM2,400,000/year
- Even 1% market share = RM240,000/year
- ROI: 1,567% in Year 1
