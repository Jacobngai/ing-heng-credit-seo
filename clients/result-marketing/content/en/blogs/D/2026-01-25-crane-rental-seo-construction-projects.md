## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### How long does crane rental SEO take to work?

**3-6 months** for local keywords like "crane rental [your area]". Crane capacity keywords (10 ton crane, 20 ton crane) take **2-4 months** (specific, high intent). Tower crane and major construction keywords take **6-12 months**.

### Should I show exact pricing on my website?

**Use ranges.** Every project is different (duration, location, requirements). Show daily/weekly ranges to set expectations. Add "exact quote based on project requirements" for accuracy.

### Do I need photos of my cranes on my website?

**Absolutely critical.** Contractors need to see:
- Your fleet (do you have the right crane?)
- Condition (well-maintained or rusty?)
- Size/capacity (can it do the job?)
- Previous projects (have you done this before?)

### Can I target crane keywords in multiple languages?

**Highly recommended.** 40% of Malaysians prefer searching in Malay or Chinese. We create content in EN/ZH/MS. Construction industry uses all 3 languages.
