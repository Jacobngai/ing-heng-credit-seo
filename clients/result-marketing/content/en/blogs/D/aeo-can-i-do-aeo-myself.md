## **What DIY AEO Actually Costs**

### The Money Breakdown

**Tools You'll Need:**

| Tool | Cost | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| SEMrush/Ahrefs | RM400/month | Keyword research, competitor analysis |
| Surfer SEO/Clearscope | RM200/month | Content optimization |
| Schema Pro/Plugin | RM150/year | Structured data markup |
| Google Analytics | Free | Traffic tracking |
| Google Search Console | Free | Performance monitoring |
| AI Writing Tool | RM100/month | Content generation assistance |
| **Total Monthly** | **~RM700/month** | |

**Compare to Agency:**
- DIY: RM700/month + your time
- Agency: RM1,200/month + zero time
- **Difference:** RM500/month saved vs. 15-20 hours/week invested

**The True Cost Calculation:**

**Hourly rate approach:**
- You value your time at RM100/hour
- DIY requires 15 hours/week
- Monthly time cost: 15 × 4 × RM100 = RM6,000
- Total DIY cost: RM700 (tools) + RM6,000 (time) = RM6,700/month
- Agency cost: RM1,200/month
- **Verdict:** Agency is 82% cheaper

**Revenue approach:**
- Those 15 hours could generate RM5,000/month in revenue
- DIY cost: RM700 (tools) + RM5,000 (opportunity cost) = RM5,700/month
- Agency cost: RM1,200/month
- **Verdict:** Agency is 79% cheaper

**The only time DIY makes financial sense:**
- Your time is worth <RM25/hour
- OR you have zero revenue-generating work to do
- OR you're learning AEO to offer it as a service

## **The Hybrid Approach: Fractional DIY**

**Best of both worlds:**

**You handle:**

**Agency handles:**
