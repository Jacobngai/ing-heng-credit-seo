## Why Facebook Ads Keep Getting Expensive

### Reason 1: Auction-Based Pricing

Facebook Ads work on a real-time auction system.

**How it works:**
1. Advertiser sets maximum bid per click
2. Facebook runs auction every time an ad loads
3. Highest bidder + best ad quality wins the impression
4. More bidders = higher prices

**The problem:**
- More Malaysian businesses advertising every year
- Same audience size = more competition
- Auction prices keep rising

**Simple supply and demand:**
- Supply: Fixed (Malaysian Facebook users ~30 million)
- Demand: Increasing (more businesses advertising)
- Result: Higher prices

### Reason 2: Ad Saturation

Malaysians see too many ads.

**Statistics:**
- Average Facebook user sees 5,000 ads/month
- 76% of users ignore sponsored posts
- Ad recall drops 50% after 3rd exposure
- Click-through rates declining 15% year-over-year

**What this means:**
To get the same results, you must:
- Bid higher (costs more)
- Create better ads (takes more time)
- Accept lower conversion (wastes money)

### Reason 3: iOS Privacy Changes

Apple's 2021 privacy update crippled Facebook's tracking.

**Impact:**
- Facebook can't track as much user behavior
- Less targeting data = less precise targeting
- Less precise = lower conversion rates
- Lower conversion = higher effective cost per lead

**Before iOS update:**
- Could track users across websites/apps
- Highly targeted custom audiences
- 5-10% conversion rates

**After iOS update:**
- Limited tracking
- Broader targeting
- 2-5% conversion rates

Same spend. Half the results.

## The SEO Alternative

- 80-250 leads/month (once established, 6-12 months)
- Cost per lead: RM5-15
- **Annual cost: RM14,400**

**Compare to Facebook Ads to get 100 leads/month:**

- SEO (average CPL RM12): RM14,400/year

**Savings: RM225,600/year**

### Compounding Returns

Here's what makes SEO different:

**Month 1-3:** Building foundations
- Traffic: 20-50 visitors/month
- Leads: 2-8 leads/month
- CPL: High (RM150-600)

**Month 4-6:** Traffic growing
- Traffic: 50-150 visitors/month
- Leads: 10-40 leads/month
- CPL: Medium (RM30-120)

**Month 7-12:** SEO compounding
- Traffic: 150-500 visitors/month
- Leads: 40-150 leads/month

**Year 2:** Maximum results
- Traffic: 300-1,000 visitors/month
- Leads: 80-300 leads/month
- CPL: Lowest (RM4-15)

Same RM1,200/month. More leads every month.

Facebook Ads? Same spend, same results (unless you increase budget).
