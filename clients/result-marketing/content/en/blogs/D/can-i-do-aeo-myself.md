## **Direct Answer: Can You Do AEO Yourself?**

Yes, you can do AEO yourself with 4-8 hours per month and RM200-600 in tools. The core tasks (FAQ schema, question-targeted content, citation monitoring) are learnable for business owners with basic technical skills. DIY works best for local businesses in low-competition niches. Expect 60-70% of agency results in 6-12 months (agencies achieve faster due to experience and tools). Hire when you have multiple locations, compete in aggressive markets, or simply lack time for consistent execution.

**Remember: The best AEO strategy is the one you actually execute consistently.**

Question: **DIY or hire?**

---

## **FAQ: DIY AEO**

### **Is DIY AEO really effective?**

Yes. DIY AEO achieves 60-70% of agency results when done consistently. The gap is speed (agencies execute faster due to experience and tools), not capability. Dedicated business owners can reach 400-800 AI citations within 6-8 months DIY.

### **What's the hardest part of DIY AEO?**

Schema markup and content velocity. Learning structured data requires technical patience. Creating 4-8 pieces of content monthly requires discipline. Most DIY failures come from inconsistency, not inability.

### **Can I switch from DIY to agency later?**

Absolutely. Many businesses start DIY to learn, then hire agencies once they understand the value. Your DIY foundation (schema, content) transfers seamlessly. Agencies accelerate from there.

### **How long until DIY AEO shows results?**

3-4 months for first AI citations. 6-8 months for significant traction (400+ citations). 12+ months for full optimization. Agencies typically achieve in 3-4 months what takes DIY 6-8 months.

### **What's the minimum viable DIY AEO commitment?**

4 hours/month + RM200 in tools (RankMath Pro). Below this, you won't build citations fast enough to compete. 6-10 hours/month + RM400 in tools is recommended for meaningful results.
