## **Direct Answer: AEO ROI Performance**

Real AEO case studies show 300-800% ROI within 6 months for businesses investing RM1,200-2,500/month. Construction equipment and local service businesses see fastest returns (60-90 days) due to high-intent searches. B2B companies experience 4-6 month ramp-up but generate larger deal sizes (RM40,000+). Key success factors: targeting queries with AI Overview presence, implementing structured data, and tracking citations + branded search lift. Top performers attribute 40-50% of organic revenue to AEO efforts.
