## **Direct Answer: What Questions Should I Ask an AEO Agency?**

**Ask these 5 questions first:** (1) Show me 3 live AI Overview citations you've achieved for clients, (2) What's your specific process for getting cited in AI Overviews, (3) Who will work on my account and what's their AEO experience, (4) What's included in your monthly retainer, (5) What's a realistic timeline for my industry? If they can't answer these clearly with proof, they're not a legitimate AEO agency.

---

## **The 20 Must-Ask Questions**

### **Category 1: Proof of Work (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

#### **1. "Show me 3 live AI Overviews where your clients are currently cited."**
**Why it matters:** Proof of capability.
**Good answer:** Shows 3+ screenshots with URLs, dates, and search queries.
**Bad answer:** "We can't show client work due to confidentiality." (Translation: We have no results.)

#### **2. "Can I speak to 2-3 current clients in similar industries?"**
**Why it matters:** Client satisfaction verification.
**Good answer:** Provides contacts with specific industries.
**Bad answer:** "Our clients are too busy" or lists irrelevant industries.

#### **3. "What percentage of your clients see AI Overview citations within 90 days?"**
**Why it matters:** Success rate indicator.
**Good answer:** "70-80% of clients see citations within 90 days."
**Bad answer:** "100%!" (Lying) or "We don't track that." (Not measuring results.)

---

### **Category 2: Technical Expertise**

#### **4. "What schema markup do you implement for AEO?"**
**Why it matters:** Technical AEO knowledge.
**Good answer:** "FAQPage, Article, Organization, Review, Product schemas."
**Bad answer:** "Schema? We focus on keywords." (Not an AEO agency.)

#### **5. "How do you optimize content for AI search engines?"**
**Why it matters:** Understanding AI content preferences.
**Good answer:** "We create direct answer blocks, comparison tables, FAQ sections, and structured data."
**Bad answer:** "We optimize keywords and meta tags." (That's 2015 SEO.)

#### **6. "What tools do you use to track AI Overview appearances?"**
**Why it matters:** Measurement capability.
**Good answer:** "Semrush Position Tracking, manual monitoring, Google Search Console."
**Bad answer:** "We just check rankings." (Not tracking AI visibility.)

---

### **Category 3: Process & Strategy**

#### **7. "What does your onboarding process look like?"**
**Why it matters:** How they start working with you.
**Good answer:** "Audit → Competitor analysis → Keyword research → Content strategy → Technical optimization."
**Bad answer:** "We start building links immediately." (Wrong approach for AEO.)

#### **8. "What's your content creation process?"**
**Why it matters:** Quality control.
**Good answer:** "In-house writers + editors, subject matter expert review, schema markup integration."
**Bad answer:** "We use AI tools" or "Outsource to freelancers."

#### **9. "How do you identify which queries to target for AI Overviews?"**
**Why it matters:** Strategic thinking.
**Good answer:** "Analyze search volume, AI Overview appearance rate, competitor gaps, and your business goals."
**Bad answer:** "We target all keywords in your industry." (Unfocused strategy.)

---

### **Category 4: Pricing & Deliverables**

#### **10. "What's exactly included in your monthly retainer?"**
**Why it matters:** Deliverable clarity.
**Good answer:** "2 content pieces, schema markup, performance report, strategy call, ongoing optimization."
**Bad answer:** "SEO services" (vague) or changes the subject.

#### **11. "Are there any additional fees I should know about?"**
**Why it matters:** Hidden costs.
**Good answer:** "No, everything is included." Or "Content creation is additional if you need more than X pieces."
**Bad answer:** "We'll discuss that later." (Red flag.)

#### **12. "What's your contract length and cancellation policy?"**
**Why it matters:** Flexibility.
**Good answer:** "3-month minimum, then month-to-month. 30-day notice to cancel."
**Bad answer:** "12-month contract, non-cancellable." (Risky commitment.)

---

### **Category 5: Timeline & Expectations**

#### **13. "What's a realistic timeline for my industry to see AI Overview citations?"**
**Why it matters:** Expectation setting.
**Good answer:** "60-90 days for initial citations, 4-6 months for consistent visibility."
**Bad answer:** "2-4 weeks!" (Lying to get your business.)

#### **14. "What happens if I don't see results in 90 days?"**
**Why it matters:** Accountability.
**Good answer:** "We'll audit our approach, adjust strategy, and continue working at no extra cost until we achieve citations."
**Bad answer:** "SEO takes time, be patient" (excuses) or blames your website.

#### **15. "How often will we communicate and what will those meetings cover?"**
**Why it matters:** Communication style.
**Good answer:** "Monthly strategy call with performance review, plus email access for questions."
**Bad answer:** "We'll send reports, you can email questions." (Impersonal.)

---

### **Category 6: Team & Experience**

#### **16. "Who specifically will work on my account and what's their experience?"**
**Why it matters:** Expertise verification.
**Good answer:** "Jane (Lead Strategist, 5 years AEO) + Mark (Content Specialist, 3 years) + you'll have my direct contact."
**Bad answer:** "Our team" (vague) or "Junior specialists" (inexperienced).

#### **17. "How long has your agency been doing AEO specifically?"**
**Why it matters:** Experience depth.
**Good answer:** "Since 2024 when AI Overviews launched. We've adapted from SEO over 8 years."
**Bad answer:** "We've always done AEO" (lying, AEO didn't exist before 2024) or "6 months" (too new).

#### **18. "What industries do you specialize in?"**
**Why it matters:** Relevance to your business.
**Good answer:** Lists specific industries with examples.
**Bad answer:** "We work with everyone!" (Generalist, not specialized.)

---

### **Category 7: Reporting & Measurement**

#### **19. "What does your monthly report include?"**
**Why it matters:** Transparency.
**Good answer:** "AI Overview citation tracking, organic traffic, keyword rankings, conversion data, next month's plan."
**Bad answer:** "Rankings and traffic" (doesn't track AI visibility).

#### **20. "How do you measure ROI for AEO?"**
**Why it matters:** Business impact.
**Good answer:** "Track leads/sales from organic traffic, compare to cost-per-acquisition, calculate lifetime value."
**Bad answer:** "We measure rankings" (vanity metric, not business results).

AI search doesn't have fixed rankings. This is a lie.

### 🚩 **"Can't show client work (confidentiality)"**
They have no results to show.

### 🚩 **"Results in 2 weeks!"**
Not realistic. 60-90 days minimum.

### 🚩 **"We've been doing AEO since 2015"**
AEO didn't exist before 2024. They're lying or confused.

### 🚩 **"RM800/month for everything!"**

## **FAQ: Vetting AEO Agencies**

### **What if an agency refuses to show case studies?**

**Answer:** Keep looking. Legitimate agencies are proud of their work and have 2-3 public examples. "Confidentiality" is almost always code for "we have no results."

### **Should I hire the cheapest or most expensive agency?**

**Answer:** Neither. Choose based on proof, process, and communication. RM1,500-3,000/month is fair for legitimate AEO. Below RM1,200 = low quality. Above RM6,000 = enterprise-level (unless you're enterprise, you're overpaying).

### **How many agencies should I interview?**

**Answer:** 3-5. Interview fewer and you might miss the right fit. Interview more and you'll get analysis paralysis. Use our 20-question framework to compare them apples-to-apples.

### **What if I don't understand their technical answers?**

**Answer:** That's okay. Ask them to explain in plain English. A good agency can make complex concepts simple. If they can't, that's a communication red flag.

### **How long should the hiring process take?**

**Answer:** 2-4 weeks. Week 1: Initial calls with 3-5 agencies. Week 2: Deep dives with 2-3. Week 3: Proposal reviews. Week 4: Final decision and onboarding. Don't rush—this is a 6-12 month commitment.
