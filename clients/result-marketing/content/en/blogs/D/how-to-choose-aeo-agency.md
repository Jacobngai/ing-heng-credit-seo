## **The AEO Agency Selection Problem**

AEO is the new SEO. Everyone claims to do it. Few actually understand it.

**The market reality:**
- 200+ agencies in Malaysia claim "AEO services"
- Only 12% have verifiable AI Overview case studies
- 67% just repackage traditional SEO as AEO
- Pricing varies wildly: RM800-15,000/month

**Choose wrong, and you waste:**
- 6-12 months of time
- RM15,000-50,000 in fees
- Opportunity cost (competitors advance)

**This guide gives you the exact framework to evaluate AEO agencies like a pro.**

---

## **Direct Answer: How to Choose an AEO Agency?**

**Select an AEO agency by verifying 4 critical factors:** (1) Proven AI Overview case studies in your industry, (2) Technical AEO expertise (schema markup, structured data), (3) Malaysia/local market knowledge, and (4) Transparent pricing with clear deliverables. Avoid agencies that can't show live AI Overview citations or promise "guaranteed #1 rankings" (AI search doesn't work that way).

**The best AEO agencies demonstrate:** Before/after screenshots of AI Overview appearances, client testimonials with verifiable businesses, clear content strategies, and realistic timelines (60-90 days for initial results).

## **12-Point AEO Agency Evaluation Framework**

### **1. AI Overview Case Studies (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

**What to demand:**
- Live AI Overview screenshots (not theoretical)
- Before/after proof
- Multiple examples across different industries
- Verifiable client businesses (real websites, real rankings)

**Red flag:** "We can't show client work due to confidentiality." Legitimate agencies have at least 2-3 public case studies.

**Ask:** "Show me 3 live AI Overviews where your clients are cited."

### **2. Technical AEO Expertise**

**What they MUST demonstrate:**
- Schema markup implementation (FAQPage, Article, Organization)
- Structured data optimization
- Content formatting for AI engines
- Technical SEO fundamentals (site speed, mobile optimization)

**Test:** Ask to see a client's schema markup. Use Google's Structured Data Testing Tool to verify.

**Red flag:** Agencies that only talk about "keywords" and "backlinks." That's SEO, not AEO.

### **3. Content Strategy Capabilities**

**AEO requires specific content formats:**
- Direct answer blocks (50-75 words)
- Comparison tables
- FAQ sections
- Step-by-step guides
- Data-driven insights

**Ask:** "What's your content creation process for AI search optimization?"

**Good answer:** "We create comprehensive guides with schema markup, FAQ sections, and data tables."

**Bad answer:** "We optimize keywords and build links." (That's 2015 SEO)

### **4. Malaysia/Local Market Expertise**

**Why it matters:**
- Search behavior differs by region
- Language nuances (EN/MS/ZH)
- Local competition landscape
- Cultural context in content

**For Malaysia agencies, verify:**
- Understanding of multi-language SEO
- Local client references
- Knowledge of Malaysian search trends

**Ask:** "How do you optimize for Malaysian businesses specifically?"

### **5. Transparency & Communication**

**What to expect:**
- Monthly reports with specific metrics
- AI Overview citation tracking
- Clear explanation of activities
- Access to analytics dashboards

**Red flag:** Vague reports showing "improvements" without data.

**Ask:** "What does your monthly report include? Can I see a sample?"

### **6. Pricing Model**

**AEO pricing ranges:**
- **RM1,200-2,500/month:** Legitimate AEO for small businesses
- **RM3,000-5,000/month:** Mid-market with comprehensive services
- **RM6,000-15,000/month:** Enterprise-level, multi-language, multiple brands

**Red flags:**
- RM800/month: Likely outsourcing or automated tools
- "Pay for performance" models: AEO requires upfront work
- Hidden fees: Clarify what's included

**Ask:** "What exactly is included in this price? Are there additional fees?"

### **7. Team Expertise**

**Who will work on your account?**
- Dedicated strategist? (Good)
- Junior specialists with oversight? (Acceptable)
- Outsourced freelancers? (Red flag)
- Automated tools only? (Run away)

**Ask:** "Who will be working on my account? What's their experience with AEO?"

### **8. Industry Experience**

**Preferred:** Agencies with experience in your industry.

**Why:** They understand your customer's questions, pain points, and search behavior.

**Good enough:** Agencies with proven AEO results in related industries.

**Ask:** "Do you have clients in [your industry]? If not, what similar industries?"

### **9. Client Retention Rate**

**The tell-all metric:**
- 80%+ retention: Excellent
- 60-79%: Good
- Below 60%: Problems

**Ask:** "What's your average client retention rate? Can I speak to 2-3 current clients?"

### **10. Onboarding Process**

**Good onboarding includes:**
- Current AI search presence audit
- Competitor analysis
- Keyword/opportunity gap identification
- Content strategy development
- Technical audit

**Ask:** "What does your onboarding process look like? How long before we start executing?"

### **11. Realistic Expectations**

**Good agencies set realistic timelines:**
- 30-60 days: Initial content creation and optimization
- 60-90 days: First AI Overview citations
- 4-6 months: Consistent visibility for target queries

**Red flag:** "You'll see AI Overview citations in 2 weeks." (Not realistic)

**Ask:** "What's a realistic timeline for seeing AI Overview results for my industry?"

### **12. Ongoing Optimization**

**AEO isn't "set it and forget it."**

**Monthly activities should include:**
- Content creation/expansion
- Schema markup updates
- Performance monitoring
- New opportunity identification
- Competitor monitoring

**Ask:** "What do you do each month after initial optimization?"

## **Red Flags to Avoid**

### 🚩 **Red Flag #1: "We Guarantee #1 Rankings"**

**Why it's a lie:** AI search doesn't have fixed rankings. AI Overviews change based on query, context, and source quality.

**Run away from:** Any guarantee of fixed positions.

### 🚩 **Red Flag #2: No AI Overview Screenshots**

**The excuse:** "We can't show client work."

**The reality:** They have no results.

**Legitimate agencies:** Proudly show case studies with before/after proof.

### 🚩 **Red Flag #3: Pricing Too Good to Be True**

**RM800/month for "comprehensive AEO"?**

**Reality:** That's below the cost of doing quality work. You'll get:
- Automated tools
- Outsourced content
- No strategy
- Zero results

**Fair pricing:** RM1,500-3,000/month for legitimate AEO services.

### 🚩 **Red Flag #4: Focus Only on Keywords**

**Old SEO:** "We'll rank you for 500 keywords!"

**AEO reality:** Keywords matter less than answering questions comprehensively.

**Agencies stuck in 2015:** Can't deliver AEO results.

### 🚩 **Red Flag #5: Vague Reporting**

**Bad report:** "Your visibility improved 50%." (Improved from what? Measured how?)

**Good report:** "Your website appeared in 12 AI Overview citations this month for [specific queries], driving 47 organic visits with 6.2% conversion rate."

> **💡 Don't Waste Money on the Wrong Agency**

Every month with a bad agency: RM3,000-8,000 down the drain. Your competitors advance. You stagnate.

**Vet agencies properly.** Use our 12-point framework.

## **Questions to Ask Before Hiring**

### **Must-Ask Questions (ask these on the first call)**

1. **"Show me 3 live AI Overviews where your clients are currently cited."**
   - If they can't, end the call.

2. **"What's your process for getting cited in AI Overviews?"**
   - Good answer: Content strategy + schema markup + technical optimization
   - Bad answer: "We optimize keywords" (that's SEO, not AEO)

3. **"What's included in your monthly retainer?"**
   - Get specific deliverables in writing

4. **"Who will work on my account and what's their AEO experience?"**
   - Verify expertise, not just sales pitches

5. **"What's a realistic timeline for my industry to see AI Overview citations?"**
   - 60-90 days is realistic. 2 weeks is a lie.

6. **"Can I speak to 2-3 current clients in similar industries?"**
   - Call them. Ask about results, communication, and ROI.

7. **"How do you measure and report AEO success?"**
   - Demand specific metrics, not vanity numbers

8. **"What happens if I don't see results in 90 days?"**
   - Good agencies have performance guarantees or adjustment clauses

9. **"Do you work with competitors in my industry?"**
   - Conflict of interest check

10. **"What's your client retention rate?"**
    - Anything below 70% is concerning

## **Malaysia-Specific Considerations**

### **Multi-Language Expertise**

**Malaysia's reality:** EN/MS/ZH content performs best.

**Your agency must:**
- Understand tri-lingual SEO
- Create content in all 3 languages
- Optimize for language-specific AI search behavior

**Ask:** "How do you handle EN/MS/ZH content for AEO?"

### **Local Search Behavior**

**Malaysian search patterns:**
- Location-specific queries ("KL," "Selangor," "Penang")
- Mobile-first usage
- WhatsApp preference for contact

**Your agency should:**
- Target location-based keywords
- Optimize for mobile AI search
- Integrate WhatsApp CTAs

**Ask:** "How do you optimize for Malaysian search behavior specifically?"

### **Understanding Local Competition**

**Klang Valley vs. Penang vs. JB:** Each has different competition levels.

**Good agencies:** Analyze local competitors, not just generic rankings.

**Ask:** "Who are my top AEO competitors in [your location]?"

## **FAQ: Choosing an AEO Agency**

### **How much does a good AEO agency cost?**

**Answer:** Legitimate AEO services cost RM1,500-3,000/month for small businesses, RM3,000-6,000/month for mid-market, and RM6,000+ for enterprise. Anything below RM1,200/month is likely low-quality work or automated tools. Anything above RM8,000/month should be justified with dedicated teams and comprehensive services.

### **Should I hire a general SEO agency or AEO specialist?**

**Answer:** AEO specialist. General SEO agencies focus on traditional ranking factors (backlinks, keywords). AEO requires specialized knowledge of AI search behavior, schema markup, and content formatting. Many SEO agencies are rebranding as "AEO" without real expertise. Verify they have actual AI Overview case studies.

### **How long before I see results with an AEO agency?**

**Answer:** 60-90 days for initial AI Overview citations. 4-6 months for consistent visibility across target queries. Agencies promising results in 2-4 weeks are lying. AI search indexing and pattern recognition take time.

### **What if I'm not happy with my AEO agency?**

**Answer:** Most contracts are month-to-month after an initial 3-6 month commitment. If you're not seeing AI Overview citations by month 3, ask for a performance review. Good agencies will adjust strategy. If they make excuses or can't show progress, it's time to switch.

### **Do I need an AEO agency or can I do it myself?**

**Answer:** Depends on your technical skills and time. AEO requires content creation, schema implementation, and ongoing optimization. If you have 10+ hours/week and technical knowledge, DIY is possible. Most business owners should hire an agency and focus on their business. The RM1,500-2,500/month fee typically pays for itself in better results and time savings.
