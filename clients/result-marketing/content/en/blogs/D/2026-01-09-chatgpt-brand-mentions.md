### Reviews Are Critical

**ChatGPT prioritizes businesses with:**

**Review strategy:**
1. **Ask every satisfied customer**
   - Right after service completion
   - Make it easy (QR code, direct link)
   - Offer incentive (discount on next service)

2. **Respond to every review**
   - Thank positive reviewers
   - Address negative reviews professionally
   - Shows active engagement

3. **Diversify review platforms**
   - Google Reviews (primary)
   - Facebook Reviews
   - Trustpilot
   - Industry-specific platforms

**Target:** 100+ reviews across platforms, 4.8+ average rating.
