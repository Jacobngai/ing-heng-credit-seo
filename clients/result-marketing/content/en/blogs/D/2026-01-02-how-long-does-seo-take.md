## Factors That Speed Up or Slow Down SEO

### Speeds Up SEO:

**Low Competition Keywords**
- "Crane rental in Cheras" (faster)
- vs. "Crane rental Kuala Lumpur" (slower)

**Existing Authority**
- Old domain (5+ years) = faster
- New domain = slower

**Technical Excellence**
- Fast website = faster
- Mobile-friendly = faster
- Good structure = faster

**Content Quality**
- Comprehensive content = faster
- Thin content = slower

**High Activity**
- Weekly updates = faster
- Monthly updates = slower

### Slows Down SEO:

**High Competition**
- Major cities (KL, Penang) = slower
- Niche keywords = faster

**New Website**
- 0-6 months old = slow start
- 12+ months old = faster

**Technical Issues**
- Slow site = slower
- Not mobile-friendly = slower
- Broken links = slower

**Low Authority**
- No backlinks = slower
- New domain = slower

**Inconsistent Work**

## SEO vs Google Ads Timeline Comparison

**Google Ads:**
- Day 1: Setup campaign
- Day 2: Ads running
- Day 3: Leads coming
- **Timeline: 2-3 days**

**SEO:**
- Month 1-2: Setup and building
- Month 3: First leads
- Month 6: Consistent leads
- **Timeline: 3-6 months**

**The trade-off:**
- **Google Ads:** Fast results, but expensive forever
- **SEO:** Slower start, but affordable and compounds

**Best strategy:** Use both initially, then transition to SEO.
