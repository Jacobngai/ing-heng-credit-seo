## The Fundamental Difference

**Google Ads = Renting**

You pay Google for every click.
- Stop paying = disappear immediately
- Costs rise every year (inflation + more competition)
- No residual value
- **Example:** RM10 per click × 100 clicks = RM1,000/month. Forever.

**SEO = Owning**

You invest in your website to rank organically.
- Rankings stay even if you pause SEO (temporarily)
- Fixed monthly cost (RM1200/month)
- Builds equity (your website becomes more valuable)
- **Example:** RM1200/month for 100-500 clicks/month. Compounding.

**The analogy:**
- Google Ads: Renting a house. Pay monthly, never build equity.
- SEO: Buying a house with a mortgage. Pay monthly, eventually own it.

## When to Use Google Ads

Google Ads aren't bad. They're just expensive long-term.

**Use Google Ads when:**

### 1. You Need Leads Immediately

**Timeline:**
- Google Ads: Leads start in 24-48 hours
- SEO: Leads start in 3-6 months

**Example:** New business launched, need cash flow NOW.

### 2. Testing a New Market

**Scenario:** You're expanding to a new location or offering a new service.

**Strategy:**
- Run Google Ads for 2-3 months
- Test if there's demand
- If profitable, invest in SEO for long-term
- If not profitable, pause Ads (only lost 2-3 months budget)

### 3. Short-Term Promotions

**Scenario:** Seasonal offer, clearance, limited-time service.

**Strategy:**
- Google Ads for the promotion period (1-4 weeks)
- Capture urgency-driven searches
- Pause when promotion ends

### 4. Highly Competitive Keywords (SEO Takes Too Long)

**Example:** "Car insurance Malaysia" - dominated by major players

**Reality:**
- SEO would take 12-24 months to rank
- Google Ads gets you Page 1 immediately
- **Decision:** Ads make sense, at least until SEO catches up

### 5. You Have the Budget and Want Maximum Traffic

**Scenario:** Established business, high margins, want to dominate.

**Strategy:**
- SEO for long-term foundation
- Google Ads for additional traffic
- **Both = maximum visibility**

**Google Ads Cost Reality:**
- Immediate results ✓
- Precise targeting ✓
- Easy to track ✓
- Scalable ✓
- BUT: Expensive (RM5-30 per click)
- BUT: Rising costs (10-15% yearly)
- BUT: Stop paying = zero leads

---

## When to Use SEO

**Use SEO when:**

### 1. You Can Wait 3-6 Months for Results

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-2: Building (minimal leads)
- Month 3-6: Growing (some leads)
- Month 6-12: Traction (consistent leads)
- Year 2+: Maximum results

**Question:** Can your business survive 3-6 months before SEO leads come?

If yes: SEO is smarter long-term.

If no: Use Google Ads temporarily while building SEO.

### 2. You Want Predictable, Fixed Costs

**Google Ads:**
- Month 1: RM2,500
- Month 2: RM2,800 (CPC increased)
- Month 3: RM3,200 (competition increased)
- Unpredictable budgeting

**SEO:**
- Month 1-12: RM1,200
- Month 13-24: RM1,200
- Predictable budgeting

**Question:** Do you prefer predictable costs?

### 3. You Want to Build Long-Term Equity

**Google Ads:**
- You're renting Google's attention
- No residual value
- Every dollar spent is gone

**SEO:**
- You're building your website's authority
- Website becomes more valuable
- If you sell your business: SEO asset has value
- **Example:** Business with good SEO sells for 2-3x more

### 4. Your Industry Has High Search Volume

**Good for SEO industries:**
- Emergency services (plumber, locksmith)
- Home services (renovation, aircond)
- Equipment rental (construction, vehicles)
- Professional services (legal, accounting)
- Local retail (restaurants, shops)

**Why?**
High search volume = lots of people searching = SEO generates substantial traffic.

**Not good for SEO industries:**
- Niche B2B (low search volume)
- Impulse purchases (no one searches for it)
- Highly regulated (can't rank quickly)

### 5. You Want to Reduce Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Google Ads CAC:**
- RM50-200 per customer (depending on industry)
- Never decreases (might increase)

**SEO CAC:**
- Month 1-6: RM100-300 per customer (high initially)
- Month 7-12: RM30-80 per customer (decreasing)
- Year 2+: RM15-40 per customer (lowest)

**SEO becomes cheaper every year.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I rank organically AND run Google Ads for the same keyword?**
A: Yes, and you should. Studies show ranking #1 organically + running ads increases total click-through rate by 50%+. You dominate the search results page.

**Q: How long before I can pause Google Ads and rely on SEO only?**
A: Typically 6-12 months. Depends on competition, your SEO investment, and how quickly Google ranks your site. Monitor: when SEO generates 80% of your leads, you can pause most Ads.

**Q: What if I pause SEO after ranking? Will I lose rankings?**
A: Eventually. SEO requires ongoing maintenance (content updates, technical monitoring, competition tracking). Pause SEO and competitors will overtake you in 3-6 months.

**Q: Is SEO really cheaper than Google Ads?**
A: Long-term: Yes, 70-90% cheaper. Short-term (first 6 months): No, Google Ads are cheaper initially because you pay for immediate results. SEO is a long-term investment.

**Q: Should I ever use Google Ads if I have good SEO?**
A: Yes, for:
- New product launches (SEO takes time)
- Seasonal promotions (urgency)
- Competitive keywords you can't rank for
- Testing new markets before investing in SEO
