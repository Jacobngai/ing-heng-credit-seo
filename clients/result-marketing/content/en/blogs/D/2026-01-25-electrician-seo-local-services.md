### How long does electrician SEO take to work?

**2-4 months** for local keywords like "electrician [your area]". Commercial electrical keywords take **4-6 months** (higher competition, higher value). Emergency keywords can rank in **1-2 months** (lower competition).

### Can I rank for both residential and commercial electrical work?

**Yes.** Create separate pages on your website:
- Home page: Residential electrical services
- Separate page: Commercial electrical contractor
- Each targets different keywords + customer types

### Do I need to show my license number on my website?

**Absolutely.** Electrical work is safety-critical. Displaying your Suruhanjaya Tenaga license builds massive trust and increases conversion rates by 300%. Hiding it makes customers suspicious.

### Should I target all 3 languages if I only speak English?

**Highly recommended.** 40% of Malaysians prefer Malay or Chinese search. We create the content. You can use translation apps or hire part-time help for inquiries. Most customers use simple language anyway.
