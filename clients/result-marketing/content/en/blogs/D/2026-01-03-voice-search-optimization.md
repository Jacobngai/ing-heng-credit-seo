## Optimizing for Voice Queries

### 1. Question-Based Content

**Voice search questions:**
- "Where can I rent a crane?"
- "How much does excavator rental cost?"
- "Who's the best plumber in Kuala Lumpur?"
- "What's the phone number for [company]?"

**Create FAQ pages:**
- Title: "Frequently Asked Questions About [Service]"
- Include common questions
- Provide direct answers

**Example:**
```markdown
## How much does crane rental cost?

Crane rental in Kuala Lumpur ranges from RM500-1500 per day depending on:
- Crane capacity (20-100 tons)
- Rental duration (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Operator included or not

For specific pricing, contact us at +60123456789 for a free quote.
```

### 2. Conversational Keywords

**Target long-tail, question keywords:**

**Instead of:**
- "crane rental" (short-tail)

**Also target:**
- "where can I rent a crane" (voice search)
- "how much does it cost to rent a crane" (voice search)
- "who offers the best crane rental service" (voice search)

**Use these in:**
- H2 headings (questions)
- Content (natural answers)
- FAQ sections

### 3. Direct Answers

**Voice assistants want ONE clear answer.**

**Format:**
- Answer first (30-50 words)
- Details after

**Example:**
```markdown
**Crane rental in Kuala Lumpur costs RM500-1500 per day.** Pricing depends on crane capacity (20-100 tons), rental duration, and whether operator is included.

For specific projects, we provide custom quotes based on:
- Site location
- Job duration
- Crane specifications
- Operator requirements
```

**Google reads the bolded answer.**

### 4. Schema Markup

**Add FAQ schema:**

```json
{
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "How much does crane rental cost?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Crane rental in Kuala Lumpur costs RM500-1500 per day depending on capacity, duration, and operator."
    }
  }]
}
```

## Featured Snippets Strategy

**What's featured snippet?**
- "Position zero" above organic results
- Large text box with direct answer
- Source of voice search answers

**Winning the snippet = Voice search answer.**

### Types of Featured Snippets

**1. Paragraph Snippet**
- Answer: 40-60 words
- Best for: Definitions, explanations

**2. List Snippet**
- Numbered or bulleted list
- Best for: How-to guides, steps

**3. Table Snippet**
- Data in table format
- Best for: Pricing, comparisons

### How to Win Featured Snippets

**Step 1: Identify snippet opportunities**

**Search your keywords**
- Look for existing featured snippet
- If none: Opportunity to claim it

**Step 2: Analyze current snippet**

**What format?** (paragraph, list, table)
**How long?** (word count)
**What's covered?**

**Step 3: Create better content**

**More comprehensive:**
- More detail
- Better structure
- More examples

**Better format:**
- Match snippet type (paragraph/list/table)
- Clear, concise answer
- Direct response (no fluff)

**Step 4: Structure for snippet**

**At top of page:**
```markdown
## [Question]

[Direct answer in 40-60 words]

[Detailed explanation follows]
```

**Step 5: Optimize and wait**

- Submit to Google Search Console
- Build backlinks to page
- Update content regularly
- **Wait 4-12 weeks** for Google to recrawl and consider your snippet

## Local Voice Search

**Voice search is LOCAL.**

**Common queries:**
- "Where's the nearest [service]?"
- "Find [service] near me"
- "What's the phone number for [business]?"
- "When does [business] open?"

**Optimize for local voice:**

### 1. Google Business Profile (Critical)

**Complete every field:**
- Business name (accurate)
- Address (exact)
- Phone number (local, not toll-free)
- Business hours (specific)
- Services (detailed)
- Photos (10+)

**Why:**
- Google reads this for voice answers
- Incomplete = missed opportunities

### 2. NAP Consistency

**Name, Address, Phone must match everywhere:**
- Website
- Google Business Profile
- Directories
- Social media

**Inconsistent NAP = Google confused = not showing in voice results.**

### 3. Location Pages

**Create pages for each service area:**

**Example:**
- "Crane Rental in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur"
- "Crane Rental in Shah Alam, Selangor"
- "Crane Rental in Penang"

**Each page includes:**
- Address
- Phone number
- Service hours
- Directions
- Reviews from that area

### 4. Natural Language Content

**Write how people speak:**

**Instead of:**
- "Our company provides comprehensive crane rental solutions..."

**Use:**
- "We rent cranes in Kuala Lumpur. Call 012-3456789 to book."

**Conversational = voice-friendly.**
