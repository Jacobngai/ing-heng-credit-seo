## **How Voice Search Differs**

### Text vs Voice Queries

**Text search:**
- "SEO pricing Malaysia"
- Keywords: concise, fragmented
- User scans 10 results

**Voice search:**
- "How much does SEO cost in Malaysia?"
- Natural language: conversational, question-based
- User expects one direct answer

**Implication:** Optimize for questions and direct answers.

---

## **Voice SEO Strategies**

### 1. Target Conversational Keywords

**Question keywords:**
- "How much does [service] cost?"
- "How long does [service] take?"
- "Where can I find [service] near me?"
- "Who's the best [service provider]?"

**Create FAQ pages** answering each question directly.

### 2. Provide Direct Answers

**Answer format:**
- Direct answer first (40-60 words)
- Position at top of page
- Use conversational language
- Include location for local queries

**Example:**
"How much does SEO cost in Malaysia?

SEO costs RM1,200-3,000 per month in Malaysia (2026). Pricing depends on keyword difficulty, competition, and scope. Most agencies require 6-12 month contracts."

### 3. Optimize for Local Voice Search

**Local queries:**
- "[Service] near me"
- "Where's the closest [service]?"
- "Find [service] in [city]"

**Requirements:**
- Google Business Profile (claimed, complete)
- LocalBusiness schema
- Local citations (consistent NAP)
- 50+ reviews (4.8+ rating)

---

## **Technical Voice Optimization**

### Mobile-First Optimization

**Voice searches happen on mobile:**
- Mobile-responsive design (critical)
- Fast load time (<3 seconds)
- Easy to read (no zooming)
- Tap-friendly buttons
- Clear contact info (click-to-call)

### FAQ Schema Markup

**Critical for voice search:**

```json
{
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "How much does SEO cost in Malaysia?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "SEO costs RM1,200-3,000 per month in Malaysia."
    }
  }]
}
```

**Why:** Voice assistants extract answers from FAQ schema.
