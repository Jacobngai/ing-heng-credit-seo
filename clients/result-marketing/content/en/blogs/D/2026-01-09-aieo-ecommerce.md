## **Product Schema for AIEO**

### Product Schema Markup

**Essential for e-commerce:**

```json
{
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "image": "https://site.com/product-image.jpg",
  "description": "Product description with benefits",
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "Brand Name"
  },
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.8",
    "reviewCount": "127"
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "url": "https://site.com/product",
    "priceCurrency": "MYR",
    "price": "299",
    "priceValidUntil": "2026-12-31",
    "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
  }
}
```

**Why:** AI engines extract product info, price, ratings, and availability from schema.

## **E-commerce Content Strategy**

### Product Page Optimization

**Each product page needs:**

1. **Direct product description** (first paragraph)
2. **Key features** (bullet points)
3. **Specifications** (technical details)
4. **Customer reviews** (50+ minimum)
5. **FAQ section** (5-10 common questions)
6. **Comparison** (vs competitors or alternatives)
7. **High-quality images** (5-10 photos)
8. **Videos** (product demo, reviews)

**Product FAQ examples:**
- "Is this product suitable for [use case]?"
- "How long does delivery take?"
- "What's the return policy?"
- "How does this compare to [competitor product]?"

## **Review Optimization**

### Reviews Are Critical for E-commerce AIEO

**AI prioritizes products with:**
- 50+ reviews minimum
- 4.5+ average rating
- Recent reviews (last 3 months)
- Detailed reviews (not just "good")

**Review strategy:**
1. **Automated review requests** (after purchase)
2. **Incentivize reviews** (discount on next purchase)
3. **Respond to reviews** (show engagement)
4. **Display reviews prominently** (on product page)
5. **Add review schema** (AggregateRating)

**Review schema:**
```json
{
  "@type": "AggregateRating",
  "ratingValue": "4.8",
  "reviewCount": "127",
  "bestRating": "5",
  "worstRating": "1"
}
```

---

## **Comparison Pages**

### Create Product Comparison Content

**AI engines cite comparison pages when users ask:**

"Product A vs Product B: Which is better?"

**Comparison page structure:**
1. **Introduction** (what's being compared)
2. **Feature comparison table**
3. **Pricing comparison**
4. **Pros and cons** of each
5. **Use case recommendations**
6. **Conclusion** (which product for which user)
7. **FAQ** (comparison questions)

**Example:** "iPhone 15 vs Samsung S24: Which Should You Buy?"

**Why:** AI cites these pages for comparison queries.
