## What Are Backlinks?

**Definition:** Links from other websites to your website.

**Why they matter:**
- Google's #1 ranking factor (after content)
- Each link = "vote of confidence" in your site
- More quality links = higher rankings

**Not all links equal:**
- Link from New York Times = 100x more powerful than link from spam site
- Relevant links (same industry) more valuable than random links
- Local links (Malaysian sites) most valuable for Malaysian businesses

**Link quality factors:**
- Domain authority (higher = better)
- Relevance (same industry = better)
- Anchor text (descriptive = better)
- Placement (in content = better than sidebar/footer)

## White-Hat vs. Black-Hat

### White-Hat (Good) ✅

**Definition:** Earning links naturally by creating valuable content.

**Examples:**
- Creating helpful resources people want to link to
- Outreach to relevant websites
- Guest posting on industry sites
- PR and media coverage
- Partnerships with suppliers/manufacturers

**Benefits:**
- Safe (won't get penalized)
- Long-lasting
- Builds authority over time

**Drawbacks:**
- Slow (months to build)
- Requires effort (creating content, outreach)

### Black-Hat (Bad) ❌

**Definition:** Manipulating links artificially.

**Examples:**
- Buying links (against Google guidelines)
- Link farms (sites created just to link)
- Private Blog Networks (PBNs)
- Comment spam
- Hidden links

**Benefits:**
- Fast results (weeks)
- Low effort (pay money)

**Drawbacks:**
- Google penalizes (can destroy your rankings)
- Short-term (links eventually devalued)
- Risky (not worth it)

**Rule:** If it feels like cheating Google, it probably is. Don't do it.

> **💋 Avoid Black-Hat SEO**
>
- Buying links = penalty risk
- Link farms = waste of money
- PBNs = Google will catch you eventually
>
- Build links properly or don't build them at all.
