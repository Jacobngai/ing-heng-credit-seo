## **Why GPS Fleet Tracking Matters**

**Without GPS tracking, you're flying blind.**

**Common problems:**
- "Where's my delivery?" (10-15 calls/day from customers)
- Drivers taking inefficient routes (wasted fuel)
- Unauthorized vehicle use (after-hours side jobs)
- No proof of delivery (he said, she said)
- Dispatch inefficiency (manual phone calls)

**Business impact:**
- Fuel wasted: 10-20% higher costs
- Customer complaints: Damaged reputation
- Staff overtime: Unnecessary hours
- Vehicle wear: Faster depreciation

**Terasek Supply case:**
- Before: Manual dispatch, no visibility
- After: GPS tracking + route optimization
- **Results:**
  - Fuel cost: RM25,000/month → RM21,250/month (15% savings)
  - Customer complaints: 15/day → 3/day (80% reduction)
  - Dispatch efficiency: +40% improvement
  - **Annual savings: RM45,000 (fuel) + RM5,000 (staff) = RM50,000**
