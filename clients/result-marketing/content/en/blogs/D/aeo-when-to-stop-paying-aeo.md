## **The "Never Stop" Myth**

Agencies love saying "SEO is never done."

Technically true. Practically misleading.

Here's the reality: **AEO compounds.** You invest RM1,200/month. Month 1: RM2,000 return. Month 6: RM8,000 return. Month 12: RM20,000 return.

The question isn't "is SEO ever done?"

The question is: **When does the marginal return drop below the marginal cost?**

That's your stopping point.

## **When AEO Actually Stops Working**

### Scenario 1: You've Hit Saturation

**Example:**
- You rank #1 for all 50 target keywords
- AI Overviews cite you for 80% of queries
- Market share: 35% (realistic ceiling for most local businesses)

**Month 13-18:**
- New leads: RM20,000/month (stable)
- AEO cost: RM1,200/month
- ROI: 16.7x

**Verdict:** Keep paying. RM1,200 for RM20,000 is a no-brainer.

**But if:**
- New leads drop to RM2,000/month
- AEO cost: RM1,200/month
- ROI: 1.7x

**Verdict:** Stop or renegotiate.

### Scenario 2: You've Built In-House Capability

**Month 1-12:** Agency handles everything
- Strategy
- Content
- Technical optimization
- Schema markup
- Reporting

**Month 12+:** Your team can now:
- Publish content without agency help
- Implement schema changes
- Track AI Overview appearances
- Adjust strategy based on data

**Verdict:** Switch to maintenance mode (RM500/month) or bring fully in-house.

### Scenario 3: Your Business Changed

**Example:** You started as "KL crane rental" and pivoted to "Malaysia-wide construction equipment leasing."

Old AEO work:
- Focused on "crane rental KL"
- Local business schema
- Location-specific content

New reality:
- Needs national SEO strategy
- Different keyword clusters
- New schema markup

**Verdict:** Stop old AEO contract. Start new one with updated strategy.

## **The 3 Exit Signals**

### Signal 1: ROI Drops Below 3x for 3+ Months

**The Math:**
```
Month 1: RM1,200 cost → RM5,000 revenue (4.2x ROI) ✅
Month 2: RM1,200 cost → RM4,500 revenue (3.8x ROI) ✅
Month 3: RM1,200 cost → RM2,500 revenue (2.1x ROI) ⚠️
Month 4: RM1,200 cost → RM2,000 revenue (1.7x ROI) ❌
```

**3 consecutive months below 3x = exit or renegotiate.**

**Exception:** First 3 months. AEO takes 60-90 days to show results. Don't judge ROI before Month 4.

### Signal 2: You've Captured All Available Market Share

**Signs you've saturated:**
- You rank #1 for ALL target keywords
- AI Overviews cite you for 90% of relevant queries
- Competitors have abandoned the niche
- Lead volume is flat for 6+ months despite optimization

**Action:**
- Switch to maintenance (RM500/month)
- Reduce publishing frequency from 4 posts/month to 1
- Focus on retention vs. acquisition

### Signal 3: You're Paying for Strategy You Can Execute In-House

**Example Timeline:**

**Months 1-6:** Agency does everything
- Strategy development
- Keyword research
- Content creation
- Technical SEO
- Schema implementation

**Months 7-12:** Your team learns by doing
- Junior marketer trained by agency
- Content templates established
- Workflow documented
- Tools and processes in place

**Month 13+:** You're ready
- Can publish 2 posts/month in-house
- Can update schema without agency help
- Have tracking dashboard for AI Overview citations
- Know how to adjust strategy

**Verdict:** Stop full retainer. Switch to quarterly consulting (RM2,000/quarter).

## **How to Exit Without Killing Results**

### Step 1: The 3-Month Wind-Down

**Month 1:** Notice + Knowledge Transfer
- Tell agency you're transitioning
- Request all accounts, passwords, assets
- Document all processes
- Train your team

**Month 2:** Joint Execution
- Agency executes, your team shadows
- Weekly handover meetings
- Your team takes over 1-2 tasks

**Month 3:** Your Team Leads
- Your team executes 80% of work
- Agency reviews and advises
- Final strategy document

**Month 4:** Full transition complete

### Step 2: Keep What Works

**Don't cancel:**
- Domain authority (you keep this)
- Existing rankings (decay slowly)
- Content library (yours forever)
- Schema markup (still active)
- AI Overview citations (persist for months)

**Do cancel:**
- Monthly retainer
- Content production
- Agency reporting
- Strategy consulting

### Step 3: Monitor for Decay

**Watch these metrics for 3 months post-exit:**

**Week 1-4:**
- Rankings: Should hold steady
- Traffic: Flat
- Leads: Flat

**Week 5-8:**
- Rankings: Minor dip (1-2 spots)
- Traffic: -5% to -10%
- Leads: -5% to -10%

**Week 9-12:**
- Rankings: If drop >5 spots, resume AEO
- Traffic: If drop >20%, resume AEO
- Leads: If drop >25%, resume AEO

## **The Compound Effect Trap**

Here's why most businesses exit too early:

**Scenario A: Exit at Month 6 (Premature)**
- Total investment: RM7,200
- Month 6 revenue: RM5,000
- Net result: -RM2,200 (loss)
- **Verdict:** "SEO doesn't work"

**Scenario B: Exit at Month 18 (Smart)**
- Total investment: RM21,600
- Month 6-18 revenue: RM120,000
- Net result: +RM98,400 (profit)
- **Verdict:** "SEO prints money"

**The difference:** Compound effects.

AEO builds on itself. Month 1 content supports Month 12 rankings. Stop at Month 6, and you kill the compounding before it pays off.

**Rule of thumb:** Commit to 12 months minimum. 18 months is better.

---

## **When You Should NEVER Stop**

**Keep paying for AEO if:**

1. **ROI is above 5x**
   - RM1,200 investment → RM6,000+ revenue
   - Why would you stop a money printer?

2. **Competitors are active**
   - They're publishing content
   - They're building citations
   - They're optimizing for AI Overviews
   - Stop = lose ground

3. **You're still ranking below #1**
   - Position #1 gets 33% of clicks
   - Position #2 gets 18%
   - Position #3 gets 11%
   - If you're not #1, there's room to grow

4. **AI Overviews don't cite you**
   - Zero citations = invisible to AI search
   - AEO is the only way to fix this
   - Stopping = staying invisible

## **Your Exit Decision Framework**

**Ask these 4 questions:**

1. **What's my current ROI?**
   - Below 3x for 3 months → Exit or renegotiate
   - 3x-5x → Maintain current arrangement
   - Above 5x → Increase investment

2. **Do I have in-house capability?**
   - No → Keep agency
   - Yes → Consider reduction or exit

3. **What's my market position?**
   - Not ranking #1 → Keep optimizing
   - Ranked #1 for everything → Maintenance mode

4. **What are competitors doing?**
   - They're active → Stay active
   - They've quit → Opportunity to dominate
