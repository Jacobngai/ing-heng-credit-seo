## YouTube SEO Optimization

### 1. Keyword Research

**Find video keywords:**
- YouTube search suggestions
- Google "video" search
- Answer The Public (questions)

**Example:**
- Search: "how to rent a crane"
- YouTube suggests:
  - "how to rent a crane for construction"
  - "crane rental cost"
  - "mobile crane rental process"

**Target these video keywords.**

### 2. Optimize Video Title

**Formula:** Keyword + Hook

**Examples:**
- "Crane Rental in KL | Complete Guide (2026)"
- "How Much Does Excavator Rental Cost? [Price Guide]"
- "Emergency Plumber Kuala Lumpur | 24/7 Service"

**Best practices:**
- Include target keyword
- 60 characters max (before truncation)
- Compelling (makes people want to click)
- Year (shows freshness)

### 3. Optimize Description

**First 2 lines (most important):**
- Include keyword naturally
- Explain what video covers
- Include CTA (call to action)

**Example:**
```
Need crane rental in Kuala Lumpur? This complete guide covers types,
pricing, and how to choose the right crane for your project.

```

**Best practices:**
- 200-500 words (longer descriptions rank better)
- Include keyword 2-3 times naturally
- Add timestamps (for long videos)
- Include contact info
- Add hashtags (3-5 relevant)

### 4. Tags

**What are tags?**
- Keywords that help YouTube understand your video

**Strategy:**
- 5-10 tags
- Mix of broad and specific

**Example:**
```
crane rental, mobile crane, excavator rental,
construction equipment, kuala lumpur, crane services
```

### 5. Thumbnail

**Most important factor for click-through rate.**

**Best practices:**
- 1280x720 resolution
- High contrast (stands out)
- Text overlay (compelling title)
- Human face (builds trust)
- Professional quality

**Avoid:**
- Low resolution
- Cluttered (too much text)
- Misleading (doesn't match video)

> **💨 Video Thumbnails Matter**
>
- 90% of video performance = thumbnail + title
- Invest in professional thumbnails
- Test different versions

- No competitor videos
- Professional appearance
- BUT: Paid (after free tier)
