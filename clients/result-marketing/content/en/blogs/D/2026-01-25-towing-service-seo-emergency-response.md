## **Converting Emergency Calls**

### Mobile Optimization is CRITICAL

**95% of towing searches happen on mobile** during emergencies. Someone stranded on the highway isn't opening a laptop.

**Your mobile site must have:**
1. **Click-to-call button** HUGE and above the fold
2. **24/7 availability** prominently displayed
3. **Service areas** clearly listed (highways covered)
4. **Response time** ("Within 45 minutes")
5. **Pricing estimate** (transparency reduces abandonment)
6. **WhatsApp button** (backup option)

### Speed is Everything

**Conversion Strategy:**
- **Auto-answer or pick up within 2 rings**
- **Ask location immediately** ("Where are you now?")
- **Give ETA** ("We'll be there in 30 minutes")
- **Confirm price** ("RM300 for this distance")
- **Text driver details** (name, phone, truck plate)

**Response Time Impact:**
- Answer in 2 rings: 80% conversion
- Answer in 5 rings: 40% conversion
- Goes to voicemail: 5% conversion

- Target 50+ reviews in first 3 months

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### How long does towing service SEO take to work?

**1-3 months** for local keywords like "towing service [your area]". Emergency towing keywords rank faster in **1-2 months** (high urgency, consistent demand). Highway-specific keywords take **2-4 months**.

### Should I show exact pricing on my website?

**Use ranges.** Every tow is different distance. Show RM ranges based on distance to set expectations. You can add "exact quote based on pickup/drop-off location" for accuracy.

### Is mobile optimization really that important for towing?

**Critical.** 95% of people search for towing on mobile DURING emergencies. If your site isn't mobile-optimized with a giant click-to-call button, you'll lose 80% of potential customers.

### Can I target towing keywords in multiple languages?

**Absolutely.** 40% of Malaysians prefer searching in Malay or Chinese. We create content in EN/ZH/MS. Emergency situations trigger searches in all languages.
