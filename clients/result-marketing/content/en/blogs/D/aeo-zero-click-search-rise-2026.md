## **The Zero-Click Shift**

Since 2024, Google's AI overviews have changed search behavior dramatically:

**The Data:**
- 2023: 15% of searches resulted in zero-clicks
- 2024: 42% zero-click searches
- 2025: 64% zero-click searches (projection)
- 2026: 70%+ zero-click searches (current trend)

**What This Means:**

- Brand visibility happens without clicks

**The Mistake:** Thinking zero-click = SEO is dead

**The Reality:** Zero-click = brand exposure at scale

## **What Zero-Click Really Means**

When someone searches "crane rental cost Malaysia" and gets an AI answer:

**Before (Traditional SEO):**
- User sees 10 blue links
- User clicks top result
- Website gets traffic
- Website gets lead

**Now (AI Search):**
- User sees AI answer
- AI cites 3-5 sources
- User reads answer on SERP
- User sees your brand 2-3 times (if cited)
- User may or may not click through

**The Value Shift:**
- Old metric: Clicks to website
- New metric: Brand impressions in AI answers
- Old goal: Drive traffic
- New goal: Get cited everywhere

**The Math:**
- 1,000 searches monthly
- AI appears: 700 times (70%)
- You get cited: 250 times (36% citation rate)
- Zero-click impressions: 250
- Brand recall lift: 40% (vs non-cited competitors)
- Value: RM125-250 in brand equity (RM0.50-1.00 per impression)
