## Why Reference Checks Matter

Here's a sobering statistic: **67% of businesses that hire SEO agencies don't check references.**

They sign 6-12 month contracts worth RM7,200-36,000 based on a sales pitch and a portfolio PDF.

Then 3 months in, they realize:
- The agency overpromised and underdelivered
- Communication is terrible
- Rankings haven't moved
- The "case study results" were exaggerated

**Reference Calls Prevent Expensive Mistakes:**

A 20-minute call with a past client can reveal:
- Whether the agency actually delivers results
- How long results really take (not what sales promised)
- What communication is really like month-to-month
- Hidden costs or contract issues
- Whether you'd want to work with them long-term

**The Cost of Skipping This Step:**
- Average AEO agency retainer: RM1,500-3,000/month
- Typical contract length: 6-12 months
- Money at risk: RM9,000-36,000
- Your time: 6-12 months of lost opportunity

Reference checks are the highest-ROI due diligence you can do.

## Questions to Ask Past Clients

**Results-Related Questions:**

1. **"What specific results did they achieve for you?"**
   - Listen for: Specific numbers, timelines, keywords
   - Red flag: "They were great, I don't recall exact numbers" (vague)

2. **"How long did it take to see meaningful results?"**
   - Listen for: Honest timeline (usually 3-6 months)
   - Red flag: "We saw results in 2 weeks" (too good to be true)

3. **"Did they meet their initial promises?"**
   - Listen for: candid yes/no with examples
   - Red flag: hesitations or excuses

4. **"What was the ROI on their services?"**
   - Listen for: Specific revenue/lead numbers
   - Red flag: "Hard to measure" (good agencies track this)

5. **"Are you still ranking for the keywords they worked on?"**
   - Listen for: Yes (results should last)
   - Red flag: No, or they dropped after leaving the agency

**Communication Questions:**

6. **"How often did you hear from them?"**
   - Listen for: At least monthly, preferably bi-weekly
   - Red flag: "Only when we reached out"

7. **"Were they responsive to questions and concerns?"**
   - Listen for: WhatsApp availability, quick email replies
   - Red flag: "Took days to respond"

8. **"Did they explain their strategy in terms you understood?"**
   - Listen for: Yes, plain language, no jargon
   - Red flag: "They were very technical" (should be accessible)

**Process Questions:**

9. **"Did they ever use tactics you were uncomfortable with?"**
   - Listen for: No, white-hat only
   - Red flag: Link schemes, keyword stuffing (black hat)

10. **"What was the onboarding process like?"**
    - Listen for: Structured, clear timeline, audit phase
    - Red flag: "They started working immediately without research"

11. **"Would you hire them again?"**
    - Listen for: Enthusiastic yes
    - Red flag: Hesitation, "maybe," or qualified yes

**Contract & Pricing Questions:**

12. **"Were there any hidden fees or upsells?"**
    - Listen for: No, transparent pricing
    - Red flag: "Extra charges for content, links, reports"

13. **"Did you have to sign a long contract?"**
    - Listen for: Month-to-month or 3-month max
    - Red flag: 12-month lock-in (hard to escape bad service)

## How to Verify Reference Claims

**Step 1: Verify the Client Actually Exists**
1. Search the business name on Google
2. Check their website looks professional
3. Look for their Google Business Profile
4. Verify they've been in business at least as long as the agency worked with them

**Step 2: Check Their Current Rankings**
If the agency claims "We ranked ABC Construction #1 for 'excavator rental KL'":
1. Search that exact keyword
2. Check if ABC Construction appears
3. Note their actual position
4. Do this for 3-5 claimed keywords

**Step 3: Compare Claims to Reality**
Sometimes agencies exaggerate past results. If they claim 300% growth but the client's current traffic looks modest, ask:
- "What was the baseline before the agency started?"
- "Are those results still current?"

**Step 4: Check LinkedIn**
1. Search the reference contact on LinkedIn
2. Verify they actually work at that company
3. Check their tenure (did they work there during the agency engagement?)
4. Look for endorsements or recommendations

**Step 5: Look for Case Study Details**
Good agencies publish detailed case studies with:
- Google Search Console screenshots (impressions, clicks, position)
- Before/after ranking data
- Timeline charts
- Specific keywords worked on

## Red Flags in Reference Calls

**The "Too Perfect" Reference:**
If everything is 100% positive with no nuance or challenges mentioned, that's suspicious. Real client relationships have ups and downs. Good references should be honest about both.

**Vague on Details:**
"I'm not sure on exact numbers... They helped with SEO... Overall it was good..."

People who saw real results remember specific outcomes. Vague answers = either the client isn't involved, or results weren't significant.

**Defensive About Agency:**
If they get defensive when you ask tough questions ("Why didn't it work faster?"), they might have a financial incentive to refer you (commission, free services, etc.).

**Can't Show Data:**
"We didn't track it closely... I don't have access to analytics..."

Professional AEO agencies give clients access to Google Search Console and ranking reports. If the reference can't show proof, that's a red flag.

**Results Dropped After Leaving:**
If rankings disappeared when they stopped paying the agency, that means:
- The agency used temporary tactics (not sustainable)
- They relied on paid links (not genuine SEO)
- Results weren't organic

Good AEO creates lasting value that persists even after the engagement ends.

**Still Paying After 12+ Months:**
Ask: "Are you still working with them?"

If yes after 12+ months, that's usually good (agency delivers ongoing value).

If they left after 6 months, ask why. Common reasons:
- Agency stopped delivering results
- Price increases
- Communication issues
- Wanted to bring SEO in-house

## FAQ

**How many references should I contact?**
Ideally 2-3 past clients. If the agency refuses or makes excuses, that's a red flag. Reputable agencies are proud to connect you with happy clients.

**What if the reference is a current client?**
Actually better—they're actively working with the agency. Ask about recent work, current communication, and whether they plan to renew.

**Can I skip reference checks if the agency has great case studies?**
No. Case studies can be cherry-picked. References give you unfiltered insight into the client experience. Always do both.

**What if the reference says mixed things (good and bad)?**
That's actually honest and valuable. Ask follow-up questions to understand context. Every agency has occasional challenges—how they handle them matters more.

**Should I pay for references?**
Never. Legitimate agencies provide references for free. If someone asks for payment or a "consultation fee" to speak to clients, walk away.
