## **The OTA Commission Problem**

**Online Travel Agencies (Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia) charge 15-25% commission.**

**Example calculation:**
- Room rate: RM300/night
- 30 nights/month × RM300 = RM9,000 revenue
- OTA commission (20%): RM1,800/month
- **Annual commission: RM21,600**

**If you could convert just 20 bookings/month to direct:**
- 20 bookings × RM300 = RM6,000 revenue
- Keep 100% (no commission) = RM6,000
- **Savings: RM1,200/month = RM14,400/year**

**SEO investment:**
- RM1,200/month × 12 = RM14,400/year
- **ROI: Break-even in Year 1, pure profit from Year 2**

**High-value hotel keywords:**

| Keyword | Monthly Searches | Booking Value |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| hotel kl | 10,000+ | RM300-800/night |
| hotel bukit bintang | 5,000+ | RM350-900/night |
| hotel penang | 5,000+ | RM250-600/night |
| hotel jb near checkpoint | 2,000+ | RM200-400/night |
| cheap hotel kl | 3,000+ | RM150-300/night |

**Create pages for:**
- `/hotel-bukit-bintang/` - Location specific
- `/business-hotel-kl/` - Business traveler
- `/family-hotel-penang/` - Family vacation
- `/budget-hotel-jb/` - Budget conscious

## **Multi-Language Hotel SEO**

**Malaysia attracts tourists from multiple regions:**

### English (EN)
- Singapore, Australia, UK, USA
- Expats in Malaysia
- Business travelers
- Keywords: "hotel kl", "business hotel"

### Chinese (ZH)
- Mainland China (fastest growing)
- Hong Kong, Taiwan
- Malaysian Chinese staycationers
- Keywords: "吉隆坡酒店" (KL hotel)
- Keywords: "槟城住宿" (Penang accommodation)

### Malay (MS)
- Domestic tourists (KL to Penang, JB to KL)
- Indonesian visitors
- Government staff travel
- Keywords: "hotel murah kl"
- Keywords: "penginapn di penang"

**Example:**
A family from Beijing searches "吉隆坡酒店" (Kuala Lumpur hotel).
If your site only has English = invisible.
If you have ZH pages = you capture the RM2,100-6,300 booking.
