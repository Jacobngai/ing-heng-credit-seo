## **Converting Renovation Leads**

### Visual Portfolio is Critical

**Renovation customers buy with their eyes.** They want to see your work before hiring.

**Portfolio Must-Haves:**
1. **Before/after photos** (compelling visual proof)
2. **Project videos** (walkthroughs of completed work)
3. **Multiple angles** (show attention to detail)
4. **Room-specific galleries** (kitchen, bathroom, living room)
5. **Commercial projects** (offices, shops, restaurants)
6. **Pricing estimates** (build trust with transparency)

### Pricing Transparency Strategy

**Renovation customers HATE hidden costs.** Display estimated pricing to increase inquiries 3x.

**Example Pricing Table:**
```
Kitchen Renovation:
- Basic: RM15,000-25,000 (standard cabinets, laminate tops)
- Mid-range: RM25,000-40,000 (solid wood, quartz tops)
- Premium: RM40,000-70,000 (custom design, imported materials)

Bathroom Renovation:
- Basic: RM8,000-15,000 (standard fittings)
- Mid-range: RM15,000-25,000 (premium tiles, rain shower)
- Premium: RM25,000-40,000 (luxury fittings, smart features)

Whole House Renovation:
- Condo: RM50,000-100,000
- Terrace house: RM80,000-150,000
- Bungalow: RM150,000-300,000+
```

**Why Ranges Work:**
- Sets realistic expectations
- Filters out tire-kickers
- Shows expertise (you know the market)
- Builds trust (no hidden costs)

### WhatsApp Inquiry Management

**70% of renovation inquiries come via WhatsApp** in Malaysia.

**WhatsApp conversion strategy:**
1. **Auto-reply with project portfolio link**
2. **Ask qualifying questions:**
   - "Property type? (condo/terrace/bungalow)"
   - "Which rooms need renovation?"
   - "Budget range?"
   - "Timeline? When to start?"
3. **Send relevant project photos** (similar to their needs)
4. **Offer free site visit + quote** (standard industry practice)
5. **Follow up within 24 hours** (speed matters)

## **Building Trust with Your Portfolio**

### Before/After Photos (Essential)

**Your portfolio is your #1 sales tool.**

**Photo Guidelines:**

- **Good lighting** (natural light best)
- **Wide shots** (show entire room)
- **Detail shots** (show craftsmanship)
- **Clean, clutter-free** (remove personal items)

### Case Study Format for Each Project

**Turn your portfolio into case studies:**

**Example Case Study:**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### How long does renovation contractor SEO take?

**3-6 months** for local keywords like "renovation contractor [your area]". Competitive keywords like "renovation contractor Kuala Lumpur" take **6-12 months**. Room-specific keywords (kitchen, bathroom) rank faster.

### Should I show exact pricing on my website?

**No, use ranges.** Every project is different. Show ranges (e.g., "RM15,000-25,000 for basic kitchen renovation") to set expectations without over-promising. Exact quotes after site visit.

### How many project photos should I have on my website?

**Minimum: 30-50 projects.** Target 100+ projects over time. Categorize by room type (kitchen, bathroom, living room) and property type (condo, house, commercial). More photos = more trust = more conversions.

### Can I target both residential and commercial renovation?

**Yes.** Create separate pages:
- Home page: Residential renovation
- Separate page: Commercial renovation (offices, shops, restaurants)
- Each targets different keywords + customer types
