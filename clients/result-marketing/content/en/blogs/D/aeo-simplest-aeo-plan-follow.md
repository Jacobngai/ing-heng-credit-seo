## **The Anti-Overwhelm AEO Plan**

Most AEO guides fail because they're too complicated.

"Build 200 backlinks, optimize 47 pages, master technical SEO, publish daily content..."

Result: You quit after 2 weeks.

**This plan is different.**

**Three rules:**
1. **Simple actions only** (nothing takes >2 hours)
2. **Consistent execution** (same 3 tasks every week)
3. **Track what matters** (AI Overview citations, not vanity metrics)

**Weekly commitment:** 10 hours
**Monthly tool cost:** RM450
**First results:** 60-90 days

- AI engines prioritize structured content

**4. Track what matters**
- Vanities: Domain authority, backlinks, page views

## **When to Switch to Agency**
