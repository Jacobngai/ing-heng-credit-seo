## **Summary: 12 AEO Proposal Red Flags**

**Key Takeaways:**
- 67% of AEO proposals contain unrealistic promises or vague deliverables

- Proposals under RM1,200/month signal low-quality work
- If they can't show AI Overview case studies, reject immediately

**Read Time:** 6 minutes | **Category:** Provider Selection

---

## **Direct Answer: What Are Red Flags in an AEO Proposal?**

**Immediate rejection signals:** (1) Guarantees of specific rankings or timelines ("#1 in 2 weeks!"), (2) No AI Overview case studies or screenshots, (3) Pricing below RM1,200/month (too cheap for quality work), (4) Vague deliverables ("we'll optimize your site"), (5) Focus on SEO tactics like backlinks instead of AEO tactics like schema markup, (6) Long-term contracts with no exit clause. **If you see any of these, keep searching.**

---

## **Red Flag #1: Guaranteed Rankings or Timelines**

**What it looks like:**
- "Guaranteed #1 rankings in 30 days!"
- "AI Overview citations in 2 weeks or your money back"
- "We guarantee 500% increase in visibility"

**Why it's a red flag:**
- AI search doesn't have fixed rankings
- AI Overviews change based on query, context, and source quality
- 60-90 days is the minimum realistic timeline
- **Guarantees = lying to get your business**

**Good proposal says:**
- "Typical results: 60-90 days for initial citations"
- "We've achieved AI Overview citations for X% of clients within 90 days"
- "Results vary by industry and competition"

---

## **Red Flag #2: No AI Overview Case Studies**

**What it looks like:**
- Proposal doesn't include examples or screenshots
- "We'll share case studies after you sign" (translation: we have none)
- References only traditional SEO results, not AI Overviews

**Why it's a red flag:**
- No proof of capability
- They're rebranding SEO as AEO without real expertise
- Legitimate agencies are proud to show results

**Good proposal includes:**
- 3+ AI Overview screenshots with URLs and dates
- Client case studies with before/after proof
- Specific examples of work they've done

> **🎯 Result Marketing Shows Proof Upfront**

**Our proposals include:**
- 15+ AI Overview case studies
- Before/after screenshots
- Client testimonials with phone numbers
- Specific deliverables and timelines

---

## **Red Flag #3: Pricing Below Market (RM800-1,200/month)**

**What it looks like:**
- "Comprehensive AEO for RM800/month!"
- "All-inclusive AEO package: RM1,000/month"
- No breakdown of how they'll deliver quality work at that price

**Why it's a red flag:**
- Quality AEO requires:
  - Content creator: RM3,000-5,000/month salary
  - Technical specialist: RM4,000-7,000/month salary
  - Tools and software: RM500-1,000/month
- RM800/month doesn't cover one employee, let alone a team
- **Too cheap = automated tools or outsourced low-quality work**

**Good proposal pricing:**
- RM1,500-3,000/month (small business AEO)
- RM3,000-6,000/month (mid-market)
- RM6,000+/month (enterprise)

---

## **Red Flag #4: Vague Deliverables**

**What it looks like:**
- "We'll optimize your website for AI search"
- "Monthly AEO activities"
- "Ongoing optimization and improvements"
- "Content creation" (how much? what type?)

**Why it's a red flag:**
- Can't measure what you can't define
- Allows agency to do minimal work
- You'll overpay for vague "activities"

**Good proposal specifies:**
- "2 blog posts per month (1,500 words each)"
- "FAQ schema implementation on 10 pages"
- "Monthly report with AI Overview citation tracking"
- "Bi-weekly strategy calls"
- "Competitor analysis every quarter"

---

## **Red Flag #5: Focus on SEO, Not AEO**

**What it looks like:**
- "We'll build 50 backlinks per month"
- "Keyword density optimization"
- "Domain authority improvement"
- "PageRank sculpting"

**Why it's a red flag:**
- These are SEO tactics (2015 era)
- AEO requires: schema markup, structured data, answer-optimized content
- **They're repackaging old SEO as new AEO**

**Good proposal focuses on:**
- Schema markup implementation
- Content formatting for AI engines
- FAQ sections and answer blocks
- AI Overview citation tracking
- Structured data optimization

---

## **Red Flag #6: Long Lock-in Contracts**

**What it looks like:**
- "12-month contract, non-cancellable"
- "6-month minimum with early termination fee"
- No mention of cancellation policy

**Why it's a red flag:**
- Locks you into bad service
- No accountability if they don't deliver
- Legitimate agencies earn your business monthly

**Good proposal terms:**
- 3-month initial commitment (time to see results)
- Month-to-month after initial term
- 30-day cancellation notice
- Performance guarantees (adjust or extend free if no results)

---

## **Red Flag #7: No Reporting Methodology**

**What it looks like:**
- "Monthly reports included" (but no sample shown)
- "We track rankings and traffic"
- No mention of AI Overview citation tracking
- Vague "improvement" metrics without specifics

**Why it's a red flag:**
- Can't verify results
- They'll hide behind vanity metrics
- No transparency

**Good proposal includes:**
- Sample monthly report
- AI Overview citation tracking
- Organic traffic and conversion data
- Next month's plan
- Access to analytics dashboard

---

## **Red Flag #8: One-Size-Fits-All Approach**

**What it looks like:**
- "Proven AEO system that works for any business!"
- Same pricing regardless of industry or size
- No mention of customization
- Template proposal with your name filled in

**Why it's a red flag:**
- Every industry has different AI search patterns
- Your business is unique
- Cookie-cutter = minimal effort

**Good proposal:**
- References your specific industry
- Addresses your unique challenges
- Customized strategy based on your goals
- Pricing based on scope (not one-size-fits-all)

---

## **Red Flag #9: Overpromising Results**

**What it looks like:**
- "You'll get 100 AI Overview citations in month 1!"
- "500% increase in organic traffic guaranteed!"
- "Dominate your entire industry in 90 days!"

**Why it's a red flag:**
- Unrealistic expectations
- Math doesn't work (most queries don't even have AI Overviews yet)
- **Setting you up for disappointment**

**Good proposal:**
- Realistic projections based on your industry
- "Typical clients see 5-15 AI Overview citations in 90 days"
- "Traffic increase of 30-50% within 6 months"
- Conservative estimates they can exceed

---

## **Red Flag #10: No Team Information**

**What it looks like:**
- "Our expert team will work on your account"
- No names or bios
- No clarification of who you'll work with
- Agency website shows no team page

**Why it's a red flag:**
- Who's actually doing the work?
- Might be one person outsourcing everything
- Lack of accountability

**Good proposal:**
- Names and roles of team members
- Experience and qualifications
- "You'll work with Jane (Strategist) and Mark (Content)"
- Direct contact information

---

## **Red Flag #11: Hidden Fees or Upsells**

**What it looks like:**
- Low base price but:
  - "Content creation: additional RM500/post"
  - "Schema markup: RM1,000 one-time fee"
  - "Reporting: RM200/month extra"
  - "Strategy calls: RM100/hour"

**Why it's a red flag:**
- Bait and switch
- You'll pay 2-3x the quoted price
- Deceptive pricing

**Good proposal:**
- All-inclusive pricing
- Clear list of what's included
- Optional add-ons clearly marked (not required)
- No surprise fees

---

## **Red Flag #12: Pressure Tactics**

**What it looks like:**
- "This price is only valid until Friday!"
- "We can only take 2 new clients this month"
- "If you don't start now, your competitors will beat you"
- Multiple follow-ups asking "when will you sign?"

**Why it's a red flag:**
- Good agencies don't pressure
- Creates false urgency
- **Desperation, not confidence**

**Good proposal:**
- Take it or leave it
- Confident in their value
- Lets you decide on your timeline
- No hard sell

---

## **FAQ: Evaluating AEO Proposals**

### **What if a proposal looks good but feels too good to be true?**

**Answer:** Trust your gut. If they're promising amazing results for RM888/month, it's a lie. Quality AEO costs RM1,500-3,000/month minimum. Anything significantly below market is cutting corners.

### **Can I negotiate proposal terms?**

**Answer:** Yes, but focus on scope and deliverables, not price. Ask for: shorter commitment, more specific deliverables, better reporting terms. Don't negotiate below RM1,500/month or you'll get low-quality work.

### **Should I ask for references from the proposal?**

**Answer:** Absolutely. Call 2-3 current clients. Ask: (1) Have you seen AI Overview citations? (2) How long did it take? (3) Are they responsive? (4) Would you renew? If they say no to references, reject.

### **What if the proposal has some red flags but some green flags?**

**Answer:** Mixed signals = investigate further. Ask for clarification on the red flags. If they can't explain clearly or get defensive, reject. Green flags don't cancel out red flags—they just warrant investigation.

### **How long should I take to decide on a proposal?**

**Answer:** 1-2 weeks is reasonable. Good agencies won't pressure you. Take time to: review the proposal thoroughly, call references, compare to other proposals, ask clarifying questions. If they pressure you to decide in 24-48 hours, that's a red flag.
