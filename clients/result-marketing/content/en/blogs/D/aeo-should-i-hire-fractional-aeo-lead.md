## **The Fractional AEO Model Explained**

**What is a fractional AEO lead?**

A senior AEO/SEO strategist who works part-time for multiple clients.

**Typical arrangement:**
- **Time:** 10-15 hours/week
- **Cost:** RM3,000-5,000/month
- **Commitment:** 3-6 month minimum
- **Location:** Remote (Malaysia-wide or global)
- **Experience:** 5-10 years AEO/SEO background

**What they do:**
- AEO strategy development
- Keyword research and content planning
- Team management (if you have content writers)
- Performance tracking and reporting
- Technical SEO oversight
- Agency coordination (if outsourcing execution)

**What they DON'T do:**
- Write all content themselves (that's 20+ hours/week)
- Build backlinks manually (delegates or uses tools)
- Handle day-to-day website updates
- Work 40 hours/week (that's full-time)

**Key difference from agency:**
- Agency: Team of specialists (strategist + writers + techs)
- Fractional: One senior person doing strategy + oversight

## **Fractional vs Agency vs Full-Time**

### Option 1: Fractional AEO Lead
**Cost:** RM3,000-5,000/month
**Time:** 10-15 hours/week
**Best for:** RM500K-2M revenue businesses

**Pros:**
- Senior expertise (fractionals are usually ex-agency or ex-corporate)
- Strategy-focused (not bogged down in execution)
- Flexible (scale hours up/down as needed)
- Cheaper than full-time
- More attention than agency (you're 1 of 3-5 clients, not 1 of 30)

**Cons:**
- Limited hours (can't do everything)
- Execution depends on your team or outsourced help
- Single point of failure (if they get sick/quit)
- May lack specialized skills (technical SEO, content creation, link building)

**Example:** RM4,000/month for 12 hours/week
- 4 hours: Strategy and planning
- 4 hours: Team management and oversight
- 4 hours: Performance tracking and reporting
- Content: Your team or freelancers execute
- Technical: Coordinates with your dev or uses tools

### Option 2: AEO Agency
**Cost:** RM1,200-5,000/month
**Time:** 0 hours (they handle everything)
**Best for:** RM100K-5M revenue businesses

**Pros:**
- Full-service (strategy + execution)
- Team of specialists (not just one person)
- Scalable (can ramp up quickly)
- Tools included (SEMush, Surfer, etc.)
- Redundancy (if someone leaves, team continues)

**Cons:**
- Less attention (you're 1 of many clients)
- Communication layers (talk to account manager, not strategist)
- Potential cookie-cutter approaches
- Contracts and minimum commitments

**Example:** RM1,200/month (Result Marketing)
- 4 blog posts/month (written by content team)
- Technical optimization (handled by tech team)
- Schema markup (implemented by dev team)
- Performance tracking (automated + manual review)
- Strategy (developed by senior strategist, overseen by account manager)

### Option 3: Full-Time AEO Lead
**Cost:** RM8,000-12,000/month
**Time:** 40 hours/week
**Best for:** RM2M+ revenue businesses

**Pros:**
- Dedicated focus (100% attention on your business)
- Institutional knowledge (knows your product/team inside out)
- Immediate availability (no scheduling meetings weeks out)
- Cultural alignment (part of your team)

**Cons:**
- Expensive (salary + benefits + EPF + SOCSO)
- Risk (if they leave, knowledge walks out the door)
- Limited perspective (one person vs. agency team)
- Management overhead (you need to manage them)

**Example:** RM10,000/month total cost
- RM7,000: Salary
- RM1,500: Benefits (insurance, medical)
- RM1,000: Tools (SEMush, Surfer, etc.)
- RM500: EPF + SOCSO

### Cost Comparison Table

| Option | Monthly Cost | Hours/Week | Attention Level | Execution |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **DIY** | RM450 (tools) | 15-20 | 100% (you) | You do everything |
| **Fractional** | RM3,000-5,000 | 10-15 | High (1 of 3-5 clients) | Your team + oversight |
| **Agency** | RM1,200-5,000 | 0 | Medium (1 of 20-30 clients) | They do everything |
| **Full-time** | RM8,000-12,000 | 40 | 100% | They do everything |

## **When Fractional Makes Sense**

### Scenario 1: You Have Content Team, No Strategy

**Situation:**
- You have 1-2 content writers (in-house or freelancers)
- They're producing content but rankings aren't improving
- No one is doing keyword research or strategy

**Solution:** Fractional AEO lead
- Develops content strategy and calendar
- Conducts keyword research
- Assigns topics to writers
- Reviews and optimizes content
- Tracks performance

**Cost:** RM4,000/month (fractional)
**Alternative:** Hire full-time for RM10,000/month
**Savings:** RM6,000/month

### Scenario 2: You're Too Big for DIY, Too Small for Full-Time

**Situation:**
- Revenue: RM800K/month
- Marketing budget: RM40K/month
- AEO is important but not 40 hours/week important
- DIY takes 15 hours/week (you don't have time)
- Full-time is overkill (maybe 15-20 hours/week of work)

**Solution:** Fractional AEO lead
- Works 15 hours/week
- Costs RM5,000/month
- Handles strategy + oversight
- Coordinates with your existing team

**Sweet spot:** This is exactly what fractional is for

### Scenario 3: You're Preparing to Hire Full-Time (Eventually)

**Situation:**
- AEO is becoming critical to your business
- Plan to hire full-time AEO lead in 12-18 months
- Want to build foundation now without RM10K/month commitment

**Solution:** Fractional AEO lead
- Builds strategy and processes
- Documents everything
- Helps hire and train full-time person when ready
- Transitions knowledge in 12-18 months

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-12: Fractional builds foundation
- Month 13: Fractional helps hire full-time
- Month 14-15: Fractional trains full-time
- Month 16: Full-time takes over, fractional exits

### Scenario 4: You Need Someone to Manage Your Agency

**Situation:**
- You hired an AEO agency (like Result Marketing)
- Results are coming but you want internal oversight
- Need someone to review strategy, reports, recommend adjustments
- Don't need full-time person to do this

**Solution:** Fractional AEO lead
- Reviews agency deliverables
- Provides strategic direction
- Coordinates between agency and internal teams
- Optimizes budget allocation

**Cost:** RM3,000/month (fractional oversight)
**Value:** Ensures RM1,500/month agency spend is optimized
**ROI:** Pays for itself if they improve agency results by 10%

---

## **When Fractional Does NOT Make Sense**

### Don't hire fractional if:

**1. You have no execution team**
- Fractional leads, doesn't execute
- Need content writers, developers, link builders
- If you don't have them, hire an agency instead

**2. You need 40 hours/week of work**
- If AEO is critical to your business (e.g., SEO company)
- You need full-time person
- Fractional can't scale beyond 15-20 hours/week

**3. You're spending <RM3,000/month on marketing**
- Fractional costs RM3,000-5,000/month
- If total marketing budget is RM2,000/month
- Fractional consumes entire budget
- DIY or cheap agency is better option

**4. You need immediate results (in 3 months)**
- Fractional takes 1-2 months to ramp up
- Then 3-6 months for strategy to show results
- Total: 4-8 months to see ROI
- If you need results faster, hire agency with existing infrastructure

---

## **How to Hire a Fractional AEO Lead**

### Step 1: Define the Scope

**Questions to answer:**
- How many hours/week do you actually need? (10? 15?)
- What will they do? (Strategy? Execution? Management?)
- What's your monthly budget? (RM3K? RM5K?)
- How long do you need them? (3 months? 12 months?)
- Do you have team for them to manage? (Writers? Devs?)

**Example job brief:**
```
Role: Fractional AEO Lead
Hours: 12 hours/week
Duration: 6-month contract (renewable)
Budget: RM4,000/month

Responsibilities:
- AEO strategy development
- Keyword research and content planning
- Oversee 2 freelance content writers
- Technical SEO coordination with dev team
- Performance tracking and monthly reporting
- Weekly strategy calls with marketing director

Requirements:
- 5+ years AEO/SEO experience
- Proven track record with AI Overviews
- Experience managing content teams
- Available for weekly calls (Malaysia time zone)
```

### Step 2: Find Candidates

**Where to look:**
- LinkedIn (search "fractional SEO lead", "contract AEO specialist")
- Upwork/Fiverr (look for top-rated pros with 5+ years experience)
- SEO Facebook groups (Malaysia SEO Community, etc.)
- Agency referrals (ask agencies if they offer fractional services)
- Result Marketing (we offer fractional consulting: RM3K/quarter)

**Red flags to avoid:**
- "Guaranteed #1 rankings" (impossible to guarantee)
- Super cheap rates (RM1,000/month = amateur or scam)
- No case studies or testimonials
- Won't provide references
- Pushes backlinks as main strategy (old-school SEO)

### Step 3: Vet Candidates

**Ask these questions:**

**1. "What's your experience with AI Overviews?"**
- Good answer: "I've helped 3 clients get cited in AI Overviews in the last 6 months. Here are examples..."
- Bad answer: "What's AI Overview?" (outdated)

**2. "How do you approach AEO strategy?"**
- Good answer: "Start with your business goals, identify high-intent keywords, create content optimized for AI engines, track citations and revenue."
- Bad answer: "Build backlinks, optimize meta tags, write blog posts." (generic SEO, not AEO)

**3. "What's your process for the first 30 days?"**
- Good answer: "Week 1: Audit and research. Week 2: Strategy document. Week 3-4: Start execution and tracking."
- Bad answer: "Start writing content immediately." (no strategy)

**4. "How do you measure success?"**
- Good answer: "AI Overview citations, keyword rankings, organic leads, revenue attribution."
- Bad answer: "Website traffic, domain authority." (vanity metrics)

**5. "Can I speak to 2 current clients?"**
- Good answer: "Absolutely, here are their contacts..."
- Bad answer: "My clients are confidential." (why?)

### Step 4: Set Clear Expectations

**Contract should include:**
- Exact hours/week and how they're tracked
- Deliverables (e.g., "1 strategy doc, 4 content plans, monthly report")
- Response time (e.g., "respond to emails within 24 hours")
- Performance metrics (e.g., "3 AI Overview citations in 6 months")
- Termination clause (e.g., "30 days notice, either party")
- IP ownership (you keep all strategies, documents, processes)
