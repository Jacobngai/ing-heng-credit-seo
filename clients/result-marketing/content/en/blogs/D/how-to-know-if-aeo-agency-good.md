## **Summary: 7 Signs of a Good AEO Agency**

**Key Takeaways:**
- Good agencies show AI Overview screenshots, not just ranking reports
- They speak in terms of citations and visibility, not "keywords ranked"
- Pricing of RM1,500-3,000/month indicates quality work
- Client retention above 80% proves satisfaction

**Read Time:** 6 minutes | **Category:** Provider Selection

## **Direct Answer: How Do I Know if an AEO Agency is Legitimate?**

**A good AEO agency demonstrates 4 non-negotiables:** (1) Live AI Overview case studies with before/after proof, (2) Deep technical knowledge of schema markup and structured data, (3) Realistic timelines (60-90 days), not promises of 2-week results, and (4) Client retention above 80%. If they lack any of these, they're either inexperienced or rebranding traditional SEO as AEO.

---

## **Sign #1: They Show AI Overview Screenshots (Not Just Rankings)**

**What this looks like:**
- Live screenshots with dates and URLs
- Multiple examples across different industries
- Before/after comparisons
- Citations in Google, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot

**Bad agencies show:**
- Ranking reports (position #1, #2, etc.)
- Traffic graphs
- "Keyword count" metrics
- No AI Overview proof

**Why this matters:** AI search is about citations, not rankings. Agencies showing rankings only are doing traditional SEO, not AEO.

---

## **Sign #2: They Speak AEO, Not SEO Language**

**Good AEO language:**
- "AI Overview citations"
- "Answer Engine Optimization"
- "Schema markup for AI search"
- "Structured data optimization"
- "Content formatting for AI engines"

**SEO language (red flag):**
- "Backlinks"
- "Domain authority"
- "Keyword density"
- "PageRank"
- "Link building"

**The difference:** AEO is about earning citations in AI answers. SEO is about ranking in traditional blue links. Good agencies understand this distinction.

---

## **Sign #3: Realistic Timelines (60-90 Days Minimum)**

**Good agencies say:**
- "60-90 days for initial AI Overview citations"
- "4-6 months for consistent visibility"
- "Results depend on competition and content quality"

**Bad agencies promise:**
- "2 weeks to AI Overviews!" (Lying)
- "Guaranteed citations in 30 days or money back" (Unrealistic)
- "We've cracked the AI search code" (Scam language)

**Why it matters:** AI search engines need time to discover, index, and test content. 60-90 days is the minimum realistic timeline for most industries.

---

## **Sign #4: Transparent Pricing (RM1,500-3,000/month)**

**Fair pricing ranges:**
- **RM1,500-2,500/month:** Small business AEO (legitimate)
- **RM3,000-5,000/month:** Mid-market with comprehensive services
- **RM6,000+/month:** Enterprise-level

**Red flags:**
- **Below RM1,200/month:** Too cheap for quality work. You'll get automated tools or outsourced labor.
- **No pricing listed:** Hiding something. Ask before committing.

**Why pricing matters:** Good AEO requires:
- In-house content creators (RM3,000-5,000/month salary)
- Technical specialists (RM4,000-7,000/month salary)
- Tools and software (RM500-1,000/month)

Agencies charging RM800/month can't afford quality team members.

---

## **Sign #5: High Client Retention (80%+)**

**Retention benchmarks:**
- **80%+:** Excellent agency
- **70-79%:** Good agency
- **60-69%:** Average (investigate why clients leave)
- **Below 60%:** Problems (avoid)

**Why retention matters:** High retention = satisfied clients. Low retention = unhappy clients. It's that simple.

**Ask:** "What's your average client retention rate? Can I speak to 2-3 current clients?"

> **💡 Result Marketing's Retention: 87%**

We keep clients because we deliver results.

**Ask our clients:** WhatsApp **+60175032281** for references.

---

## **Sign #6: Clear Process & Methodology**

**Good agencies explain:**
1. **Audit phase:** Current AI search presence analysis
2. **Strategy phase:** Keyword and opportunity identification
3. **Content phase:** Creation of answer-optimized content
4. **Technical phase:** Schema markup implementation
5. **Optimization phase:** Ongoing improvements based on performance

**Bad agencies are vague:**
- "We'll optimize your site" (How?)
- "We build authority" (Using what tactics?)
- "Trust our process" (What process?)

**Transparency = confidence in their method.**

---

## **Sign #7: Industry-Specific Experience**

**Preferred:** Agencies with clients in your industry.

**Why it matters:**
- They understand your customer's questions
- Know industry-specific AI search patterns
- Have relevant case studies to show
- Faster path to results

**Good enough:** Agencies with related industry experience.

**Example:** If you're a construction equipment rental company, an agency with industrial/manufacturing clients is a good fit. They might not have construction specifically, but they understand B2B industrial search behavior.

---

## **Red Flags: Bad Agency Signs**

### 🚩 **Red Flag #1: "We Guarantee #1 Rankings"**

**Why it's bad:** AI search doesn't have fixed rankings. AI Overviews change based on context and query. Guarantees are lies.

### 🚩 **Red Flag #2: No AI Overview Screenshots**

**The excuse:** "Client confidentiality."

**The reality:** They have no results. Legitimate agencies have 2-3 public case studies.

### 🚩 **Red Flag #3: Focus on Backlinks**

**Old tactic:** Building links for authority.

**AEO reality:** AI engines care about content quality and structured data, not backlinks. Agencies focused on links are stuck in 2015 SEO.

### 🚩 **Red Flag #4: Pricing Below Market**

**RM800/month for AEO?**

**Reality:** Below cost of quality work. You'll get:
- Automated tools
- Outsourced content (often low quality)
- No strategy
- Zero results

### 🚩 **Red Flag #5: "Results in 2 Weeks"**

**Not possible.** AI search engines need 60-90 days minimum to discover and cite new content.

## **FAQ: Evaluating AEO Agencies**

### **What if an agency has good case studies but low retention?**

**Answer:** Investigate why. Good results but low retention might mean poor communication, pricing issues, or scope creep. Ask to speak to former clients to understand why they left.

### **Can a good agency be new (less than 1 year old)?**

**Answer:** Possible but risky. New agencies might lack experience, even if they're talented. Look for: (1) Previous SEO experience they're adapting to AEO, (2) Lower pricing to offset risk, (3) Initial results they can show. If they have none of these, wait until they build a track record.

### **Should I choose an agency based on price?**

**Answer:** No. Choose based on proof and process first, then compare pricing among qualified agencies. RM1,500-3,000/month is fair. Below RM1,200 is suspicious. Above RM5,000 should be justified with dedicated teams and comprehensive services.

### **Do good agencies always have industry-specific experience?**

**Answer:** Preferred but not required. What matters more: (1) Understanding of AEO technical requirements, (2) Proven results in any industry, (3) Ability to learn your industry quickly. A great generalist AEO agency beats a mediocre specialist.

### **How do I verify AI Overview case studies are real?**

**Answer:** (1) Check the URLs exist and are live, (2) Search the queries yourself to see if they still appear, (3) Ask for client contact to verify, (4) Look for dates (recent is better than old), (5) Request before/after screenshots showing improvement.
