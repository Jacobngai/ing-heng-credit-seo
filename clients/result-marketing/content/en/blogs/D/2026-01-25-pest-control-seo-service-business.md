## **Converting Pest Control Leads**

### Mobile Optimization for Pest Inquiries

**80% of pest control searches happen on mobile**. Someone seeing cockroaches in their kitchen isn't opening a laptop.

**Your mobile site must have:**
1. **Click-to-call button** prominent above the fold
2. **WhatsApp button** (preferred by 65% of Malaysians)
3. **Pests treated** clearly listed (termites, cockroaches, rats, etc.)
4. **Service areas** (suburbs you cover)
5. **Emergency service badge** (if available)
6. **Pricing ranges** (builds trust)

### Trust Signals for Pest Control

## **Building Recurring Revenue**

**Turn one-time jobs into recurring contracts:**

**Step 1:** Deliver exceptional one-time service
- Arrive on time
- Professional uniform + equipment
- Explain treatment process
- Before/after photos
- Follow-up call (ensure satisfaction)

**Step 2:** Make contract offer immediately
- "Save RM200/year with our annual plan"
- "4 visits/year = pest-free home guaranteed"
- "Free re-treatment if pests return within 30 days"
- "Priority emergency response"

**Step 3:** Easy sign-up
- WhatsApp contract agreement
- Monthly auto-debit option
- No long-term lock-in (cancel anytime)

**Conversion Rate Impact:**
- One-time jobs only: 8% become contracts
- Proactive contract offer: 28% become contracts
- **250% increase in recurring revenue**

### Commercial vs. Residential Focus

**Commercial pest control = Higher value, steady income**

**Commercial keywords:**
- "office pest control" - 400 searches/month
- "restaurant pest control" - 300 searches/month
- "hotel pest control" - 200 searches/month

- Factory/warehouse: RM4,000-10,000/year

**SEO Strategy:**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### How long does pest control SEO take to work?

**2-4 months** for local keywords like "pest control [your area]". Termite-related keywords take **3-5 months** (higher value, higher competition). Commercial pest control keywords rank in **4-6 months**.

### Should I target residential or commercial pest control?

**Both.** Create separate pages on your website. Commercial has higher value and recurring contracts. Residential has more volume but lower contract value. Diversify for stability.

### Can I rank for pest control keywords in multiple languages?

**Absolutely.** 40% of Malaysians prefer searching in Malay or Chinese. We create content in EN/ZH/MS. Your website automatically serves the right language based on user preference.

### Do I need to show pricing on my website?

**Highly recommended.** Pest control customers hate "call for pricing" responses. Transparent pricing (ranges) increases conversion rates by 150%. You can show "starting from" pricing if exact costs vary by property size.
