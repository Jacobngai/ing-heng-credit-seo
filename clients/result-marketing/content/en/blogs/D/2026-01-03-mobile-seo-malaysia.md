## Mobile-First Indexing Explained

**Google changed how it ranks websites (2018-2021).**

**Old way:**
- Google looked at DESKTOP version
- Used desktop to rank (for both desktop and mobile)

**New way (Mobile-First Indexing):**
- Google looks at MOBILE version
- Uses mobile to rank (for both mobile AND desktop)

**What this means:**
- If your mobile site sucks → you rank poorly everywhere
- If you have no mobile site → you rank poorly everywhere
- Mobile optimization is now mandatory, not optional

**Malaysia context:**
- 90%+ smartphone penetration
- 80% of searches on mobile
- 50%+ of website traffic mobile
- **If you're not mobile-optimized, you're invisible to most customers.**

## Mobile SEO Checklist

### 1. Responsive Design (Required)

**What is it?**
- Site adapts to screen size automatically
- Same URL for desktop and mobile
- Best practice (Google recommends)

**Check:**
- Open your site on phone
- Does it fit screen width (no horizontal scroll)?
- Is text readable (no zooming needed)?
- Are buttons tap-friendly (not tiny)?

**If NO:** Your site needs responsive design.

### 2. Page Speed (Critical)

**Mobile speed benchmark:**
- Good: Load under 4 seconds
- Excellent: Load under 3 seconds
- Poor: Load over 4 seconds

**Test:**
- PageSpeed Insights (pagespeed.web.dev)
- Test MOBILE speed specifically

**Common mobile speed issues:**
- Large images
- Too much code
- Slow hosting
- Too many plugins

**Fix:**
- Compress images
- Enable caching
- Minify code
- Upgrade hosting

### 3. Readable Text (No Zooming)

**Font size minimum:**
- Body text: 16px
- Headings: 24px+

**Check:**
- Can you read without zooming?
- Is text large enough on small screen?

**If NO:** Increase font size.

### 4. Tap-Friendly Buttons

**Button size minimum:**
- 48x48 pixels (Apple guideline)
- Easy to tap with thumb

**Check:**
- Can you tap buttons easily?
- Are buttons spaced apart (not too close)?

**If NO:** Enlarge buttons, add spacing.

### 5. No Flash or Pop-Ups

**Avoid:**
- Flash (doesn't work on mobile)
- Intrusive pop-ups (blocks content)
- Interstitials (full-screen ads)

**Google penalizes sites with intrusive pop-ups.**

**Instead:**
- Use HTML5 (not Flash)
- Non-intrusive CTAs (banner at bottom/top)
- Slide-in from side (doesn't block content)

### 6. Simplified Navigation

**Mobile menu:**
- Hamburger menu (3 lines icon)
- Collapsible sections
- Back buttons (easy navigation)

**Avoid:**
- Complex mega-menus (hard on mobile)
- Too many menu items (overwhelming)
- Deep navigation (hard to find content)

> **💌 Losing Mobile Visitors?**
>
- 53% of mobile users leave if site doesn't load in 3 seconds
- 80% leave if site is hard to use
- Mobile optimization = conversion rate increase
