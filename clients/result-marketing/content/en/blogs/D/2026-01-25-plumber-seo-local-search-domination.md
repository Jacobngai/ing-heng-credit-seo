## **The Plumbing SEO Opportunity**

Every month, **8,500+ Malaysians search for plumbing services**. Burst pipes, clogged drains, leaking taps - water problems can't wait.

These searches represent **high-intent customers ready to pay** for immediate service. Not casual browsers. People with WATER flooding their homes.

**The Revenue Math:**
- Average emergency plumbing job: RM200-500
- Average routine maintenance job: RM150-300
- Monthly searches: 8,500+
- Capture just 10% = 850 jobs/month
- 850 jobs × RM250 average = **RM212,500/month opportunity**

But most plumbers rely on:
- Word-of-mouth (slow growth)
- Expensive directory listings (low quality leads)
- Facebook ads (interrupting people who don't need plumbing)

**SEO solves this** by putting your business in front of people ACTIVELY searching for plumbing help.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### How long does plumber SEO take to work?

**2-4 months** for local keywords like "plumber [your area]". Competitive keywords like "emergency plumber Malaysia" take **4-6 months**. We target easy wins first for quick ROI.

### What if I don't have a physical shop?

Most plumbers are **mobile service businesses**. We optimize for **service areas**, not physical locations. Your Google Business Profile shows your service radius instead of a storefront.

### Can I rank for plumbing services in multiple cities?

**Yes.** Create location pages for each area you serve. Example: "plumber Kuala Lumpur", "plumber Petaling Jaya", "plumber Shah Alam". Each page targets that specific city's keywords.
