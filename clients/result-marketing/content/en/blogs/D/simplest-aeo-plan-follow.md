## **Direct Answer: Simplest AEO Framework**

The simplest effective AEO plan has 4 steps: (1) Add FAQ schema with 10-15 questions to your top 5 service pages, (2) Publish 3 question-targeted articles monthly (how-to, pricing, comparison), (3) Manually check 50 core queries for AI Overview citations weekly, (4) Monitor branded search growth in Google Search Console. This 4-5 hour monthly routine delivers 60-70% of agency results within 6 months. Focus on queries already triggering AI Overviews, optimize for citation format (tables, lists, Q&A), and maintain consistency.

## **FAQ: Simple AEO Plan**

### **Is this really enough to compete with agencies?**

Yes, for 60-70% of agency results. Agencies add: advanced schema (Article, Organization), faster content velocity (6-8 posts/month), professional tools (Semrush, Surfer SEO), and experience. But this simple plan delivers the core 80/20: FAQ schema, question-targeted content, citation monitoring.

### **What if I miss a week of monitoring?**

It's fine. Weekly monitoring is ideal, but bi-weekly still works. The key is consistency over intensity. Missing one week won't kill your results. Missing 3-4 months will. Build a sustainable routine you can maintain long-term.

### **Can I do just 1-2 articles per month instead of 3?**

Yes, but results will be slower. 3 articles/month = 800-1,000 citations in 6 months. 2 articles/month = 500-700 citations. 1 article/month = 300-400 citations. More content velocity = faster citation growth. Do what you can sustain.

### **How do I find the 50 queries to monitor?**

Start with Google Search Console. Look at your current queries. Add "how much", "how to", "near me" modifiers. Check AnswerThePublic (free tier) for question ideas. Ask your sales team: "What questions do customers ask before buying?" You'll have 50+ quickly.

### **What's the minimum viable version of this plan?**

Absolute minimum: (1) Add FAQ schema to 3 pages (1 hour, one-time), (2) Create 2 question-targeted posts monthly (2 hours), (3) Monitor 20 core queries bi-weekly (1 hour). Total: 3 hours/month. You'll get 40-50% of agency results. Better than nothing.
