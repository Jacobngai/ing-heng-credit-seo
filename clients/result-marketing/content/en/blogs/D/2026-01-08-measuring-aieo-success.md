## **Why Measuring AIEO Matters**

### What Gets Measured Gets Managed

**AIEO is new, so metrics are evolving.**

**Unlike traditional SEO** (established metrics like rankings, traffic), **AIEO requires new tracking methods.**

**Why measure:**
- Prove ROI to stakeholders
- Identify what's working
- Adjust strategy based on data
- Justify continued investment
- Compete for AI citation budget

### The AIEO Funnel

**Awareness → Citation → Traffic → Engagement → Lead → Revenue**

**Measure each stage:**
1. How often AI cites you (awareness)
2. How many click through (traffic)
3. How long they stay (engagement)
4. How many convert (leads)
5. How much revenue generated (ROI)

## **AI Citation Metrics**

### 1. Citation Frequency

**What to track:**
- How many AI citations per week/month
- Which AI engines cite you (ChatGPT, SGE, Copilot, Perplexity)
- Which queries trigger citations
- Citation position (1st cited, 2nd cited, etc.)

**How to measure:**
- Manual: Search target keywords weekly, document citations
- Tools: Google Search Console (AI Overview report), Bing Webmaster Tools (AI Chat report)
- Third-party: Brandwatch, Mention (AI mention tracking)

**Benchmark:**
- Starting: 0-5 citations/month
- Good: 10-20 citations/month
- Excellent: 30-50+ citations/month

### 2. Citation Share

**What to track:**
- Your share of AI citations vs competitors
- Market share in AI recommendations
- Growth rate over time

**How to measure:**
- Search target keywords
- Count total citations (yours + competitors)
- Calculate your percentage

**Example:**
"SEO services Malaysia" search
- Total AI citations: 5
- Your citations: 2
- Share: 40%

### 3. Citation Quality

**What to track:**
- Which AI engines cite you (prioritize Google SGE, ChatGPT)
- Citation context (positive, neutral, negative)
- Citation prominence (first mentioned vs last mentioned)

**Why:** Not all citations equal. Being first cited = 40% more clicks.

**Benchmarks:**
- Dwell time: 3+ minutes (good)

- Return visitors: 20%+ (good)

### 3. Branded Search Volume

**What to track:**
- How many search for your brand name

## **Lead and Revenue Metrics**

### 1. Lead Volume

**What to track:**
- Leads from AI-referred traffic
- Lead quality (qualified vs unqualified)
- Lead source (which AI engine)

**How to measure:**
- CRM tracking (HubSpot, Salesforce)
- Lead source attribution
- Ask leads "How did you hear about us?"

**Benchmark:**

### 2. Cost Per Lead (CPL)

**Calculate:**
Total AIEO investment / Number of leads = Cost per lead

**Example:**

- Leads from AI: 30/month
- CPL: RM50

**Compare to other channels:**
- Google Ads: RM100-300/lead
- Facebook Ads: RM80-200/lead
- AIEO: RM30-80/lead (typically lower)

### 3. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Calculate:**
Total AIEO investment / Number of customers = CAC

**Example:**
- AIEO investment: RM1,500/month
- Customers from AI: 10/month
- CAC: RM150

### 4. Return on Investment (ROI)

**Calculate:**
(Revenue from AI - AIEO investment) / AIEO investment = ROI

**Example:**
- Revenue from AI: RM7,500/month
- AIEO investment: RM1,500/month
- ROI: 400%

**AIEO ROI benchmarks:**
- Year 1: 200-300%
