---

## **The Problem - Expensive Airbnb Commissions**

iHousing Paradise was growing but paying massive fees to platforms.

**Problem 1: 30-40% Total Commission on Every Booking**

**Commission breakdown:**
- Airbnb platform fee: 15-20%
- iHousing management fee: 15-20%
- **Total: 30-40% from rental income**

**Example booking:**
- RM500/night × 3 nights = RM1,500
- Airbnb fee (15%): RM225
- iHousing fee (15%): RM225
- **Total deductions: RM450**
- Property owner receives: RM1,050 (70% of revenue)

**Business impact:**
- Property owners unhappy with high fees
- iHousing margins squeezed by Airbnb commission
- Difficult to compete on price
- **Lost revenue: RM25,000-40,000/month in Airbnb fees**

**Problem 2: Zero Online Presence Outside Airbnb**

**Before SEO:**
- No website
- No Google rankings
- Invisible to travelers searching Google
- 100% dependent on Airbnb for bookings
- **Organic traffic: 0 visitors/month**

**Search volume missed:**
- "airbnb kl bukit bintang": 800+ searches/month
- "serviced apartment klcc": 600+ searches/month
- "holiday home penang": 500+ searches/month
- "condo for rent short term kl": 1,000+ searches/month
- **Total missed opportunity: 2,900+ searches/month**

**Problem 3: Manual Review Process**

**Before automation:**
- Property managers manually messaged guests
- Generic "please leave a review" messages
- Response rate: 20-30%
- Low review volume affected rankings
- **Time spent: 10 hours/month on review requests**

**Business impact:**
- Fewer reviews = lower Airbnb ranking
- Lower ranking = fewer bookings
- Fewer bookings = less revenue
- **Vicious cycle of declining visibility**

**Problem 4: No Direct Booking Strategy**

**100% Airbnb dependency meant:**
- No guest data ownership
- No repeat guest marketing
- No control over pricing strategy
- Airbnb algorithm changes directly affected revenue
- **Business risk: High**

- Send review request via WhatsApp + email
- Higher response rate (guest not in rush)

**Step 3: Smart routing**
- 5-star reviews: Direct guest to Airbnb, Booking.com
- 4-star or lower: Route to internal feedback form
- Protects online reputation
- Addresses issues privately

**Step 4: Automated follow-up**
- No response after 3 days: Gentle reminder
- Another 3 days: Final reminder (different channel)
- Maximize review capture rate

**Review request template:**
```
Hi [Guest Name]! Thanks for staying with us.
How was your experience at [Property Name]?
Your feedback helps us improve and helps future guests.
Click here to leave a quick review: [Airbnb link]
Takes 2 minutes. Thank you! 🙏
```

**AI complaint routing:**
- Sentiment analysis detects negative reviews
- AI routes to appropriate team:
  - Cleanliness issue → Housekeeping manager

- 24-hour response guarantee
