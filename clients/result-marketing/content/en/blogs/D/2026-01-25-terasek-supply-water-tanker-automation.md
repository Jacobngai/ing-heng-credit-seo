## **The Problem - Manual Paperwork & Slow Collections**

Terasek Supply was growing but hitting operational limits.

**Problem 2: 2-Month Collection Time**
- Delivery: Day 1-30
- Paperwork travel: Day 31-40 (JB → KL → HQ → accounts)
- Invoice generation: Day 41-45
- Invoice delivery: Day 46-50
- Payment processing: Day 51-60
- **Total: 60 days from delivery to payment**

**Problem 3: Manual Admin Work**

- Courier costs: RM500/month for document transport
- Admin salaries: RM2,500/month per staff
- **Total admin cost: RM12,500/month + RM6,000 courier/year**

**Problem 4: Cannot Accept Outstation Jobs**
- JB → KL route only (regular)
- Outstation jobs (Penang, Kuantan) required staff travel
- Physical document pickup needed
