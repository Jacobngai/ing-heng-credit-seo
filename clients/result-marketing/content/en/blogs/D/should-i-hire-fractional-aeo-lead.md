**Remember: The right AEO investment level matches your business stage.**

Question: **Which path fits your growth?**

---

## **FAQ: Fractional AEO Lead**

### **Is a fractional AEO lead worth RM3,000-5,000/month?**

Yes, if you have 3+ locations or RM50,000+ monthly revenue. Fractional delivers 2-3x DIY execution speed with professional expertise. Break-even typically within 60-75 days. For single-location businesses, DIY or full agency makes more sense.

### **What's the difference between fractional and agency?**

Fractional = one senior expert, 100% of their attention on your business during their hours. Agency = team of juniors + seniors, attention split across all agency clients. Fractional costs more per hour but gives you dedicated focus. Agency spreads cost across team but dilutes attention.

### **Can fractional leads handle technical work?**

Yes, most can. Schema markup, site speed optimization, technical audits are all within scope. For complex development work (coding fixes), they'll recommend developers. But AEO technical work is mostly schema and content structure, which fractional handles easily.

### **How long should I commit to fractional AEO lead?**

Minimum 6 months. AEO takes 3-4 months to show meaningful results. If you commit less, you won't see ROI. After 6 months, reassess: if you've hit citation saturation (1,200+), scale back to maintenance mode (less fractional time needed).

### **Can I transition from DIY to fractional to agency?**

Absolutely. Many businesses do: DIY for 3-6 months (learn fundamentals), fractional for 6-12 months (accelerate growth), then agency for scale (if needed). Or fractional ongoing if agency overhead doesn't make sense. Fluid transitions are normal.
