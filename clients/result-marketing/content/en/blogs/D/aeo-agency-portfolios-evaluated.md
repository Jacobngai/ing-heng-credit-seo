## What Makes a Good AEO Portfolio

When evaluating AEO agency portfolios, most Malaysian business owners make one critical mistake: they look at the design instead of the data.

A good portfolio isn't about pretty logos and nice graphics. It's about **proven, measurable results** in AI search optimization.

**What you should see:**

**Specific Metrics:**
- "Grew organic traffic by 540% in 6 months" (with before/after screenshots)
- "Ranked #1 for 47 keywords in construction equipment niche"
- "AI Overview citation rate increased from 0% to 34% in 90 days"
- "Generated RM84,000 in leads from SEO in 47 days"

**Industry Relevance:**
Look for case studies in similar industries. An AEO agency that understands construction equipment rental will deliver better results for your crane rental business than a generalist agency.

**Timeframe Transparency:**
Good portfolios show the timeline. "6 months to reach page 1" is honest. "We ranked in 2 weeks" is suspicious (and usually temporary).

**Long-Term Results:**
Portfolios should show rankings that STAY, not just spike and drop. Ask to see 12+ month performance data.

## Red Flags in Agency Portfolios

**Vague Claims Without Proof:**
- "We help businesses grow" (How much? What metrics?)
- "Hundreds of satisfied clients" (Show me 5 specific ones)
- "Guaranteed results" (Without showing how)

**Generic Before/After Numbers:**
- "Increased traffic 300%" (From 10 to 30? From 10,000 to 30,000?)
- "Ranked on page 1" (For which keyword? How competitive?)
- "More leads generated" (How many? What's the value?)

**Outdated Case Studies:**
If the most recent case study is from 2022, ask yourself: What have they done lately? SEO and AEO change fast. Tactics from 2022 might not work in 2026.

**No Industry Experience:**
If you're in equipment rental and their portfolio only shows restaurants, e-commerce sites, and personal blogs, that's a red flag. AEO for local service businesses requires different strategies.

**Missing Contact Information:**
If they can't (or won't) provide client references you can actually call, that's suspicious. Real agencies have happy clients who will vouch for them.

## How to Verify Portfolio Claims

**Step 1: Check Google Search Console Screenshots**
Real agencies show GSC data. Look for:
- Impression growth
- Click-through rates
- Average position improvements
- Specific keyword rankings

**Step 2: Verify Live Rankings**
Take the keywords from their case studies and search them yourself. If they claim to rank #1 for "excavator rental Kuala Lumpur," actually search it.

**Step 3: Ask for Client References**
A good agency will give you 2-3 past or current clients you can contact. Ask them:
- Did the agency deliver on promises?
- How long did it take to see results?
- Was communication good?
- Would you hire them again?

**Step 4: Check Their Own Rankings**
If an AEO agency can't rank their own site for "AEO services Malaysia" or "SEO agency Kuala Lumpur," why would they rank yours?

**Step 5: Look for AI Overview Citations**
Search their client's brand name or top keywords in Google. Do they show up in AI Overviews? That's real AEO proof.

## Questions to Ask About Case Studies

When reviewing an AEO agency portfolio, ask these specific questions:

**About the Results:**
1. "What was the starting point for traffic/rankings?" (Baseline matters)
2. "How long did these results take?" (Timeline management)
3. "Are these results still current?" (Sustainability check)
4. "What tactics did you use to achieve this?" (Method matters)

**About the Client:**
1. "What was the client's budget?" (Context for results)
2. "Did the client have existing SEO work?" (Building from scratch vs. optimizing)
3. "What was the client's primary goal?" (Leads, traffic, brand awareness?)

**About the Strategy:**
1. "Would you use the same strategy for my industry?" (Customization)
2. "What's changed in AEO since this case study?" (Current knowledge)
3. "What would you do differently today?" (Honesty and learning)

## FAQ

**How long does it take to see AEO results?**
Most clients see initial ranking improvements in 30-60 days, with significant traffic increases by month 3-6. AI Overview citations typically appear 60-90 days after implementing structured data and answer-optimized content.

**What if an agency has no portfolio?**
New agencies aren't necessarily bad, but they should offer a trial period or money-back guarantee. Ask for their personal results if they don't have client case studies yet.

**Should I only hire agencies with big brand clients?**
Not necessarily. Big brands often have natural advantages (domain authority, brand recognition). Look for agencies that've helped businesses similar to YOUR size and industry.

**What's more important: portfolio size or results quality?**
Results quality. An agency with 3 amazing case studies is better than one with 50 mediocre ones. Focus on relevance to your industry and specific, verified metrics.

**How do I know if portfolio results are real?**
Ask for Google Search Console screenshots, verify live rankings yourself, and request client references you can contact. Real agencies will happily provide proof.
