## **The Problem - 60-Day Collection Cycle**

**Terasek Supply's collection process was painfully slow.**

**Timeline breakdown:**
- Day 1-30: Water delivery (throughout month)
- Day 31-40: Paperwork travels from JB → KL → HQ
- Day 41-45: Manual data entry, invoice generation
- Day 46-50: Invoice delivery to customer
- Day 51-60: Customer processes payment
- **Total: 60 days from delivery to cash in bank**

**Business impact:**
- Monthly revenue: RM300,000
- Cash tied up in receivables: RM600,000 (2 months)
- Cannot reinvest in growth (new trucks, expansion)
- Cash flow stress (paying bills before collecting)

**Why it matters:**
- Every day delayed = lost opportunity cost
- Money sitting in receivables earns 0% return
- Could be invested in growth (15-30% ROI)

## **The Solution - Digital Workflow Automation**

Result Marketing implemented a paperless billing workflow.

### Before: Manual Paperwork Chain
1. **Delivery:** Driver carries paper delivery order
2. **Signature:** Customer signs physical document
3. **Transport:** Courier picks up documents (next day)
4. **Travel:** 3-5 days JB → KL → HQ
5. **Entry:** Admin manually types data into system
6. **Invoice:** 2-3 days to generate invoice
7. **Delivery:** Courier sends invoice to customer
8. **Payment:** Customer processes payment (10+ days)

**Total: 60 days**

### After: Digital Instant Workflow
1. **Delivery:** Driver carries tablet
2. **Signature:** Customer signs digitally (instant timestamp)
3. **Transmission:** Document uploaded to cloud (instant)
4. **Sync:** HQ receives immediately (real-time)
5. **Auto-invoice:** System auto-generates invoice (same day)
6. **Delivery:** Email invoice instantly
7. **Payment:** Customer pays faster (received faster)
8. **Tracking:** Auto-payment reminders (Day 30, 45, 60)

**Total: 30 days**

**Key improvements:**
- **Paperwork travel:** 10 days → 0 days (eliminated)
- **Data entry:** 2 days → instant (auto-populate)
- **Invoice generation:** 3 days → same day
- **Payment reminders:** manual → automated

> **💡 How Much Cash Is Tied Up in Your Receivables?**
>
- Monthly revenue × 2-3 months collection time
- Example: RM300,000 × 2 months = RM600,000 idle cash

- Receivables outstanding: RM300,000 (1 month)
- Cash available for operations: RM600,000

**Cash freed up: RM300,000**

### What to Do with Extra RM300,000?

**Option 1: Invest in Growth**
- Buy 2 new water tankers: RM300,000
- Additional revenue: RM60,000-100,000/month
- **ROI: 20-33% per year**

**Option 2: Reduce Debt**
- Pay off RM300,000 loan at 8% interest
- **Savings: RM24,000/year in interest**

**Option 3: Emergency Fund**
- Keep RM300,000 as buffer
- **Benefit: Peace of mind, weather any crisis**

### ROI Calculation

**Automation cost:**
- RM1,500/month × 12 = RM18,000/year

**Cash flow benefit:**
- RM300,000 freed up
- If invested at 15% conservative return = RM45,000/year
- Or interest savings = RM24,000/year

**Net benefit:**
- RM45,000 (investment returns) - RM18,000 (automation cost) = RM27,000/year
- **ROI: 150% in Year 1**
