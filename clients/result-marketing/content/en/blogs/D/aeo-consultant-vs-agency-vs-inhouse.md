### **AEO Agency**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Immediate expertise (no hiring/training time)
- ✅ Full-service (strategy + content + technical + reporting)
- ✅ Team of specialists (not just one person)

- ✅ Proven processes from multiple clients

**Cons:**
- ❌ Monthly recurring cost
- ❌ Less control than in-house
- ❌ Communication overhead (meetings, reports)

### **AEO Consultant**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Lower one-time cost (vs. ongoing agency fees)
- ✅ Strategic expertise without execution costs
- ✅ You own the strategy and IP
- ✅ Train your internal team

**Cons:**
- ❌ You must execute (requires time and skills)
- ❌ No ongoing optimization (unless you pay for more consulting)
- ❌ Execution risk (your team might not implement correctly)
- ❌ Consultant moves on to next client (not invested in long-term results)

**Cost:** RM3,000-8,000/project (one-time), RM10,000-15,000 for comprehensive strategy

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to develop strategy, 3-6 months for your team to execute

**Best for:** Businesses with existing marketing teams who just need AEO expertise and direction

**Example:** You have 2 content writers and 1 developer. Hire a consultant for RM5,000 to create the AEO roadmap, then your team executes it.

---

### **In-House AEO Team**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Complete control over strategy and execution
- ✅ Dedicated focus (not splitting attention across clients)
- ✅ Institutional knowledge (team learns your business deeply)
- ✅ No agency markup (you pay salary, not agency margin)
- ✅ Real-time collaboration (sit in on meetings, slack, etc.)

**Cons:**
- ❌ High fixed cost (salary + benefits + equipment + software)
- ❌ Hiring time (2-4 months to find good talent)
- ❌ Single point of failure (if person leaves, knowledge leaves)
- ❌ Limited perspective (one person's experience vs. agency's multiple clients)
- ❌ Training required (AEO is new, most candidates lack experience)
- ❌ Management overhead (you manage them, not the other way around)

**Cost:**
- **Junior AEO specialist:** RM3,500-5,000/month
- **Senior AEO specialist:** RM6,000-10,000/month
- **Plus:** Benefits (~20%), software (RM500/month), equipment (RM3,000 one-time)
- **Total first-year cost:** RM50,000-120,000

**Timeline:** 2-4 months to hire, 6-12 months to reach peak productivity

**Best for:** Businesses spending RM5,000+/month on agencies with consistent AEO needs

**Break-even point:** If spending RM5,000+/month on agencies, in-house becomes cost-effective (but only if you can hire and retain good talent).

---

## **Decision Framework**

### **Choose an AEO Agency If:**
- You need results within 90 days
- You don't have existing marketing team to execute AEO
- You want proven expertise without hiring/training
- Your budget is RM1,500-5,000/month
- You want flexibility (scale up/down as needed)

**This is 90% of businesses.**

### **Choose an AEO Consultant If:**
- You have 2+ marketing team members (content, technical)
- Your team can execute but lacks AEO strategy expertise
- You want to build internal AEO capability
- Your budget is RM3,000-10,000 (one-time)
- You're willing to wait 4-6 months for results

**This is 8% of businesses (usually mid-market companies).**

### **Choose In-House If:**
- You're currently spending RM5,000+/month on agencies
- AEO is critical to your business (core marketing channel)
- You have time to hire and manage employees
- You want long-term cost efficiency (2+ years)
- You can afford the hiring risk (wrong hire = wasted time)

**This is 2% of businesses (enterprise or high-growth companies).**

> **💡 Not Sure? Start with an Agency.**

You can always build in-house later. Most businesses start with an agency, learn what works, then hire in-house once they know exactly what they need.

**Start with Result Marketing:** RM1,200-2,500/month, cancel anytime.

## **Cost Comparison Over 12 Months**

| Model | Months 1-12 | Total Cost | Results Timeline |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| **Agency** | RM2,000/month | RM24,000 | 60-90 days |
| **Consultant** | RM5,000 (one-time) + RM8,000 (your team execution time) | RM13,000 | 120-180 days |
| **In-House** | RM7,000/month salary + RM1,400 benefits | RM100,800 | 180-270 days |

**Analysis:**
- **Agency:** Most expensive monthly, but fastest results and lowest risk
- **Consultant:** Lowest upfront cost, but execution risk and slower results
- **In-house:** Most expensive overall, but cost-effective if spending RM5,000+/month on agencies

---

## **Hybrid Approach: Agency + In-House**

**Some businesses use both:**
- **Agency:** Strategy, technical AEO, reporting (RM1,500/month)
- **In-house:** Content creation, basic optimization (your existing team)

**Cost:** RM1,500/month + existing team salaries
**Benefits:** Best of both worlds—agency expertise + in-house execution

**This works if:** You have content writers but lack AEO technical expertise.

---

## **When to Switch from Agency to In-House**

**Switch signals:**
- Spending RM5,000+/month on agency services
- AEO is your #1 or #2 marketing channel
- You have consistent, predictable AEO needs (not project-based)
- You have time to hire and manage employees

**Process for switching:**
1. **Month 1-3:** Hire in-house person while keeping agency
2. **Month 3-6:** In-house shadow agency, learn processes
3. **Month 6:** Transition execution to in-house, keep agency for consulting
4. **Month 12:** Evaluate—cancel agency or keep for specialized work

**Don't switch too early:** Most businesses switch at RM5,000+/month spend. Below that, agencies remain more cost-effective.

---

## **Red Flags: When Each Model Goes Wrong**

### **Agency Red Flags:**
- Disappears after onboarding (set up and forget)
- Changes your account manager frequently
- Can't show AI Overview results after 90 days
- Vague reporting without specific metrics

### **Consultant Red Flags:**
- No experience in your industry
- Can't show previous consulting results
- Doesn't provide written strategy/document
- Disappears after project delivery

### **In-House Red Flags:**
- Person leaves after 6-12 months (knowledge loss)
- Single point of failure (only one person knows AEO)
- Stale expertise (not learning as AI search evolves)
- Salary creep (costs balloon beyond RM10,000/month)

---

## **🚀 Ready to Choose Your AEO Model?**

**Questions to ask yourself:**
1. How fast do I need results? (Agency = 60-90 days, In-house = 6+ months)
2. Do I have team to execute? (If no, agency. If yes, consultant or agency.)
3. What's my budget? (Below RM5,000/month = agency. Above = consider in-house.)
4. How important is AEO to my business? (Critical = in-house eventually. Important = agency.)

**If you're still deciding, start with an agency.** You can always switch later.

**Remember:** 90% of businesses should start with an agency. Only switch to in-house when spending RM5,000+/month.

**Question:** Are you going to choose the fastest path to results (agency) or the slowest (in-house)?

## **FAQ: AEO Service Models**

### **When should I switch from agency to in-house?**

**Answer:** When spending RM5,000+/month on agencies consistently. Below that, agencies remain more cost-effective when you factor in salary, benefits, hiring time, and management overhead. Most businesses switch after 2-3 years with an agency.

### **Can I hire an agency and a consultant together?**

**Answer:** Yes, but usually redundant. Agencies provide strategy as part of their service. Hire a consultant only if you want a second opinion on your agency's strategy, or if you want to build in-house capability and need a roadmap.

### **How do I know if my team can execute AEO themselves?**

**Answer:** You need: (1) Strong content writer who can create comprehensive guides, (2) Developer or technical person to implement schema markup, (3) Marketer to analyze AI search opportunities. If you lack any of these, hire an agency, not a consultant.

### **What if I hire in-house and it doesn't work out?**

**Answer:** You're out 2-4 months of salary plus recruitment costs. This is why most businesses start with agencies (lower risk, cancel anytime). Only go in-house when you've done agency AEO for 2+ years and know exactly what you need.

### **Do agencies charge less than consultants long-term?**

**Answer:** Yes, initially. Consultants charge RM3,000-15,000 one-time. Agencies charge RM1,500-3,000/month. Break-even is around month 4-6. After that, consultants are cheaper long-term—but only if you can execute effectively yourself. Most can't, which is why agencies provide better ROI.
