## **The AI Search Engine Architecture**

### Core Components

**1. Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- GPT-4 (OpenAI, Microsoft Bing)
- Gemini (Google)
- Claude (Anthropic)

**Purpose:** Understand queries, generate natural language answers

**2. Web Crawlers**

- Retrieves 50-100 potential sources

**3. Source Evaluation**
- AI scores each source on:
  - Authority (domain strength, backlinks)
  - Relevance (topic alignment)
  - Quality (content depth, accuracy)
  - Freshness (recent updates)
  - Trust (E-E-A-T signals)

**4. Answer Generation**
- AI synthesizes information from top sources
- Creates conversational response
- Ensures accuracy and completeness

**5. Citation Selection**
- AI chooses 3-5 best sources
- Generates citations with links
- Provides reasoning for recommendations

- LocalBusiness (for local businesses)
- Organization (for brand entity)

**Why:** AI engines extract structured data more easily than unstructured HTML.

### 2. Demonstrate E-E-A-T

**Show experience:**
- Case studies with real results
- Client testimonials with specifics
- Before/after metrics
- Industry awards and recognition

**Show expertise:**
- Author bios with credentials
- In-depth guides (3,000+ words)
- Research and data
- Unique insights

**Show authoritativeness:**
- Backlinks from authority sites
- Media coverage and PR
- Industry contributions
- Speaking engagements

- Genuine reviews (50+)
- Secure website (HTTPS)

### 3. Create Answer-First Content

**Structure:**
1. Direct answer (first paragraph)
2. Detailed explanation
3. Examples and data
4. Conclusion

**Example:**
"How much does SEO cost in Malaysia?

SEO costs RM1,200-3,000 per month in Malaysia (2026). Pricing depends on keyword difficulty, competition, and scope. Most agencies require 6-12 month contracts.

[Detailed explanation...]"

**AI engines can easily extract and cite the direct answer.**
