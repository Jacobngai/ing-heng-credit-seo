## Why Local SEO Matters

Local SEO is the highest-ROI marketing channel for location-based businesses.

**The "Near Me" Revolution:**
- "Near me" searches increased 200% since 2020
- 76% of people who search on mobile visit a business within 24 hours
- 28% of those searches result in a purchase
- **Local searchers have 30-50% conversion rates**

**For service businesses:**
- Plumber in Cheras: "emergency plumber near me" = 300 searches/month
- Aircond service in PJ: "aircond service petaling jaya" = 500 searches/month
- Crane rental in KL: "crane rental kuala lumpur" = 700 searches/month

**The opportunity:**
One optimized Google Business Profile = 50-200 calls/month (depending on industry)

**The problem:**
Most Malaysian businesses have incomplete profiles:
- 60% have no photos
- 50% have no reviews
- 70% don't post updates
- 80% don't respond to reviews

**The solution:**
Complete Google Business Profile optimization = dominate local search.

## Google Business Profile Optimization

### Step 1: Claim and Verify Your Profile

**If you don't have a profile:**
1. Go to google.com/business
2. Click "Manage now"
3. Enter business name
4. Choose business category (CRITICAL - choose the most specific)
5. Add location (must be real address, no PO boxes)
6. Verify (postcard mailed to address in 5-14 days)

**If you have a profile:**
1. Go to google.com/business
2. Sign in
3. Check profile completion status

### Step 2: Complete Every Section

**Business Information (100% Required):**
- Business name (exact match on signboard)
- Address (must match signboard, website, directories)
- Phone number (mobile preferred for service businesses)
- Website URL
- Service hours (be specific, not "24/7" if not true)
- Business category (PRIMARY ranking factor - choose carefully)

**Service Areas (For Service Businesses):**
- Don't list your address (hide address setting)
- Instead, list service areas:
  - "Kuala Lumpur"
  - "Petaling Jaya"
  - "Shah Alam"
  - "Klang"
- Google will show you in these areas when people search "near me"

**Business Description (750 characters):**
Include:
- What you do
- How long you've been in business
- What makes you different
- Your service area
- Call to action

**Example (Plumber):**
```
Ahmad Plumbing Services provides emergency plumbing, pipe repair,
and drainage solutions in Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya, and Shah Alam.
Operating since 2015 with 20+ years experience. 24/7 emergency service,
30-minute response time, 100% satisfaction guarantee. Call now for
free quote: 012-3456789.
```

**Services Section (List Specific Services):**
Don't just say "Plumbing services."

**Instead:**
- Emergency pipe repair
- Water heater installation
- Toilet repair and installation
- Drain cleaning
- Leak detection
- Pipe replacement
- Bathroom plumbing

**Why?**
Google matches searches to specific services.

### Step 3: Upload High-Quality Photos

**Photos increase profile views by 40%+ and action (calls/directions) by 25%+.**

**Minimum photos to upload:**
1. Logo (high resolution, transparent background preferred)
2. Exterior (building entrance, signboard visible)
3. Interior (show your workspace, team)
4. Team (owner + staff, professional attire)
5. At work (showing your service being performed)
6. Equipment/vehicles (if applicable)
7. Before/after (if applicable - renovations, repairs)

**Photo requirements:**
- Minimum 720x720 pixels
- Good lighting (natural light best)
- Not blurry
- Show real business (not stock photos)

**Upload strategy:**
- 5-10 photos initially
- Add 2-3 new photos monthly (shows Google you're active)
- Geotag photos (add location data)

> **💡 Still Not Showing Up in Local Search?**
>
> Every month you wait: 500 potential customers search for your service in your area. They're finding your competitors instead.

## Review Strategy That Works

Reviews are the #1 local SEO ranking factor.

### Why Reviews Matter

**Google's 3 factors for local ranking:**
1. Relevance (does your business match the search?)
2. Distance (how close are you?)
3. **Prominence (how well-known/reputable are you?)** ← Reviews

**More reviews = higher prominence = higher rankings**

### How to Get Reviews (Ethically)

**Strategy 1: Ask at Point of Delight**
- After completing a job
- After solving a problem
- After customer says "thank you"
- **Timing matters: Ask when customer is happiest**

**What to say:**
```
"Thank you for your business! We'd really appreciate a quick
Google review if you have 30 seconds. It helps other customers
find us. Just search 'Ahmad Plumbing Kuala Lumpur' on Google
and click 'Write a review'. Thank you!"
```

**Strategy 2: Send Follow-Up Message (24-48 hours later)**

**WhatsApp template:**
```
Hi [Name]! Thanks again for choosing us. How is everything
working out? If you're happy, we'd really appreciate a Google
review. Here's the link: [short link]

Just 1 sentence is enough. Thanks! - [Your Name]
```

**Strategy 3: Make It Easy**
- Create a short link (bit.ly) directly to your review page
- Add QR code on receipts, business cards, invoices
- Send link via WhatsApp (preferred by Malaysians)
- Don't make them login multiple times

**Strategy 4: Incentivize (Carefully)**
- **NOT allowed:** "RM20 discount for 5-star review" (violates Google policy)
- **Allowed:** "Leave a review, get RM20 off your NEXT service" (future discount)

**Review targets by industry:**
- Emergency services: 50+ reviews (high competition)
- Home services: 30+ reviews
- Local retail: 40+ reviews
- Restaurants: 100+ reviews

### Respond to Every Review

**Positive reviews:**
```
Thank you so much, [Name]! We really appreciate your kind words.
Looking forward to serving you again! - [Your Name]
```

**Negative reviews:**
```
Hi [Name], we're very sorry to hear about your experience.
This isn't the standard we aim for. Please contact us directly
at [phone/WhatsApp] so we can make this right. - [Your Name]
```

**Why respond?**
- Shows you care
- Improves your rating (people update reviews after you fix issues)
- Converts unhappy customers to happy ones
- Shows potential customers you're responsive

## Local SEO Ranking Factors

Google considers 200+ factors for local SEO. These matter most:

### The Big Three

**1. Google Business Profile Completeness (Weight: 25%)**
- Claimed and verified
- All sections complete
- 10+ photos
- Categories selected correctly
- Service areas defined
- Posts published monthly

**2. Reviews (Weight: 30%)**
- Quantity (more reviews = higher ranking)
- Quality (average rating 4.0+ minimum)

- Diversity (different customers, not all same day)
- Response rate (respond to 80%+ of reviews)

**3. Proximity (Weight: 20%)**
- Business location to searcher
- Can't control (move closer to city center?)
- Service areas help (show you serve their area)

### Secondary Factors (Still Important)

**4. Website SEO (Weight: 10%)**
- Mobile-friendly (critical - 80% of local searches are mobile)
- Fast loading (under 3 seconds)
- NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone match everywhere)
- Local content (mention service areas)
- Schema markup (LocalBusiness schema)

**5. Local Citations (Weight: 5%)**
- Listings in local directories:
  - Yelp Malaysia

**6. Backlinks (Weight: 5%)**
- Links from local websites:

  - Local bloggers

**7. Behavioral Signals (Weight: 5%)**
- Click-through rate (more people click your listing = higher ranking)
- Calls/directions (more actions = higher ranking)

### The "Secret" Factor: Activity

**Google favors active businesses.**

- Respond to all reviews
- Q&A answers (if asked)

**Monthly activities:**
- Update business hours (if changed)

---

**Remember: Every month you wait, your competitors are collecting reviews and climbing above you in local search.**

Question: **How long before you're invisible in "near me" searches?**

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long before my Google Business Profile shows up?**
A: Immediately after verification. But it takes 1-3 months to rank on Page 1 for competitive keywords. Focus on reviews and activity to speed this up.

**Q: Can I have multiple locations on one profile?**
A: No. Each location needs its own Google Business Profile. You can manage multiple locations from one account dashboard.

**Q: Should I use my home address for my Google Business Profile?**
A: Only if customers actually come to your home (retail, restaurant). If you're a service business (plumber, cleaner), hide your address and list service areas instead.

**Q: How often should I post on my Google Business Profile?**
A: At least once per week. Google Posts stay visible for 7 days, so weekly posting ensures you always have fresh content showing.

**Q: Can I remove negative reviews?**
A: Only if they violate Google's review policy (spam, hate speech, conflicts of interest). Flag inappropriate reviews for removal. For legitimate negative reviews, respond professionally and try to make it right.
