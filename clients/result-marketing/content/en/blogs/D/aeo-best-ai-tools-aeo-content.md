### Tool 1: ChatGPT Plus (RM70/month)

**Best for:**
- AEO strategy development
- Content outlines and structure
- FAQ generation for schema markup
- Competitor analysis prompts
- Meta description writing

**How to use for AEO:**

**Prompt for AI Overview optimization:**
```
Create a comprehensive outline for an article about [TOPIC].
The goal is to get cited in Google AI Overviews.
Include:
1. Direct answer block (50-75 words)
2. Clear section headers
3. FAQ section with 5 questions
4. Comparison table if relevant
5. Step-by-step instructions
6. Statistics and data placeholders
```

**Prompt for schema FAQs:**
```
Generate 10 frequently asked questions about [TOPIC].
Each answer must:
- Be 40-60 words
- Provide a direct, clear answer
- Include a specific number or statistic
- Be written in simple language
- Format as Q&A pairs
```

**Prompt for competitor analysis:**
```
Analyze this competitor's content: [URL]
Identify:
1. What questions they're answering
2. What data/statistics they use
3. Their content structure
4. Gaps we could fill
5. How we could make this more comprehensive
```

**Limitations:**
- Can produce generic content

**How to use for AEO:**

**Workflow:**
1. Enter target keyword (e.g., "crane rental KL")
2. Surfer analyzes top 10 ranking pages
3. Provides content score (0-100)
4. Suggests word count, headings, keywords to include
5. Real-time optimization as you write

**AEO-specific features:**
- Identifies question-based keywords
- Suggests FAQ topics
- Analyzes competitor content structure
- Recommends semantic keywords

**Pro tip:**
Aim for content score 80+. Target 90+ for critical money pages.

**Cost-benefit:**
- RM200/month = RM2,400/year
- If it helps you rank 1 month faster
- And that ranking generates RM5,000/month

### Tool 3: Claude Pro (RM70/month)

**Best for:**
- Long-form content generation
- Nuanced, human-like writing

**How Claude differs from ChatGPT:**

Target audience: [AUDIENCE]
Tone: Professional, direct, numbers-driven
Include:
- Real-world examples
- Malaysian market context
- Specific statistics (use [DATA] placeholders)
- Comparison tables
- FAQ section
```

**Example output:**
Instead of generic: "SEO is important for business"

Claude produces: "For KL construction companies, ranking #1 for 'crane rental near me' generates 47 calls/month at RM50/click in Google Ads. That's RM2,350/month saved."

**Limitations:**
