## Mobile Optimization

**Google is mobile-first.**

**What this means:**
- Google looks at MOBILE version of your site
- Uses mobile version to rank (for both mobile AND desktop)
- If your mobile site sucks, you rank poorly everywhere

**Check if mobile-friendly:**
- Google Search Console → Mobile Usability report
- Or test on your phone

**Mobile-friendly means:**
- Text readable without zooming
- Buttons tap-friendly (not tiny)
- No horizontal scrolling
- Content fits screen width
- No Flash or annoying pop-ups

**Responsive design:**
- Site adapts to screen size
- Same URL for desktop and mobile
- Best practice (Google recommends)

**Separate mobile site (m.domain.com):**
- Old approach
- More complex
- Not recommended

---

## Indexing

**Indexing = Google knows your page exists.**

**How Google discovers pages:**
1. Crawls your site (follows links)
2. Adds pages to database (indexed)
3. Ranks pages (shows in search results)

**Check indexing:**
- Google Search Console → Coverage report
- Search `site:yourdomain.com` on Google

**Should see:**
- All important pages listed
- No "Errors" (pages Google can't index)

**Common indexing problems:**

**1. Pages blocked by robots.txt**
- Fix: Allow important pages in robots.txt

**2. Noindex tag**
- Fix: Remove noindex from pages you want ranked

**3. Duplicate content**
- Fix: Canonical tags or 301 redirects

**4. Low quality content**
- Fix: Improve or remove thin/low-quality pages

**Speed up indexing:**
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- Get backlinks (Google finds you faster)
- Update content regularly (Google recrawls active sites)

> **💡 Pages Not Indexed?**
>
- Google can't rank what it can't find.
- We fix indexing issues and get all pages indexed.

## Crawlability

**Crawling = Google exploring your site.**

**Make it easy for Google:**

**1. Clear site structure**
- Homepage → Categories → Pages
- Logical navigation
- Sitemap

**2. Internal linking**
- Link between related pages
- No orphan pages (pages with no links to them)
- Breadcrumbs (navigation path)

**3. Fix broken links**
- 404 errors (pages not found)
- Redirect old pages to new pages
- Check regularly with Google Search Console

**4. Allow crawling**
- robots.txt shouldn't block important pages
- No complex JavaScript hiding content
- Simple URL structure

**Check crawlability:**
- Google Search Console → Coverage report
- Look for "Crawled - currently not indexed"
- These pages exist but Google chose not to index (usually low quality)

---

## Sitemap

**What is it?**
- XML file listing all your pages
- Tells Google about your site structure
- Helps Google find and index pages

**Create sitemap:**
- Most CMS platforms auto-generate (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)
- Check: `yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`

**Submit to Google:**
- Google Search Console → Sitemaps
- Paste sitemap URL
- Click Submit

**Keep sitemap updated:**
- Add new pages
- Remove deleted pages
- Resubmit after major changes

---

## Schema Markup

**What is it?**
- Code that helps Google understand your content
- Creates rich results (stars, prices, etc. in search results)

**Common schema types:**
- LocalBusiness (for local businesses)
- Product (for e-commerce)
- Article (for blog posts)
- FAQ (for FAQ pages)

**Example: Local Business Schema**
```json
{
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Ahmad Plumbing Services",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Jalan ABC",
    "addressLocality": "Kuala Lumpur",
    "addressRegion": "Wilayah Persekutuan",
    "postalCode": "50000"
  },
  "phone": "+60123456789",
  "priceRange": "$$"
}
```

**Result:**
Google shows your address, phone, hours in search results.
