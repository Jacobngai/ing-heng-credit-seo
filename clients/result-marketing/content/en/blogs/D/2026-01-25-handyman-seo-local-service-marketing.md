## **Building Repeat Business**

### Repeat Customer Strategy

**One-time jobs become recurring when you:**

**1. Do exceptional work**
- Clean up after yourself (customers LOVE this)
- Arrive on time (or text if running late)
- Wear shoe covers (protect their home)
- Explain what you're doing (builds trust)
- Follow-up call (ensure satisfaction)

**2. Make recurring offers**
- "Annual home maintenance plan: RM600/year"
- "4 visits/year = inspections + minor repairs"
- "10% discount on all repairs"
- "Priority emergency response"

**3. Stay top of mind**
- WhatsApp them every 6 months: "Time for gutter cleaning?"
- Seasonal reminders: "Monsoon coming - check your windows"
- Holiday checklist: "Need help with decorations?"

**Lifetime Value Impact:**
- One-time customer: RM200 value
- Repeat customer (3 jobs/year × 3 years): RM1,800 value
- **9x difference in customer value**

### WhatsApp Marketing for Handymen

**Build a WhatsApp customer list:**

**After every job:**
1. Send before/after photos
2. Ask: "Can I message you with home maintenance tips?"
3. Add to your broadcast list
4. Send monthly tips (not sales):
   - "Monsoon season: Check your gutters"
   - "Tip: Don't ignore leaky taps - they get worse"
   - "Time to check smoke detectors"

**When they need repairs again:**
- They message YOU first
- You become their "go-to handyman"
- No more searching for "handyman near me"

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### How long does handyman SEO take to work?

**2-3 months** for local keywords like "handyman [your area]". Specific repair keywords (furniture assembly, door repair) rank faster in **1-2 months** (lower competition).

### Should I list all my services on my website?

**Absolutely.** Customers need to know what you do. List every service you offer - even small ones. You never know what someone is searching for. "TV mounting" might be your most profitable service.

### Can I target handyman keywords in multiple languages?

**Highly recommended.** 40% of Malaysians prefer searching in Malay or Chinese. We create content in EN/ZH/MS. You can use translation apps or hire part-time help for inquiries.

### Do I need to show exact pricing for every job?

**No, use ranges.** Every job is different. Show hourly rates (RM80-120/hour) and ranges for common jobs. This manages expectations while remaining flexible for complex repairs.
