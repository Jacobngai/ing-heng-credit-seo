**Remember: This checklist works if you work it. Consistency beats intensity.**

Question: **Will you finish what you start?**

---

## **FAQ: AEO DIY Checklist**

### **Can I shorten this 90-day timeline?**

Yes, if you invest more time. 10-15 hours/week can achieve in 60 days what takes 90 days at 3-5 hours/week. But most businesses burn out at that pace. 90 days at sustainable intensity is better than 60 days then quitting.

### **What if I miss a week?**

Don't stress. Pick up where you left off. Missing one week adds 7 days to your timeline, not failure. The key is consistency over 90 days, not perfection every week. 11 out of 12 weeks completed still gets results.

### **Do I need to complete every single task?**

Core tasks are mandatory (schema, content creation, citation monitoring). Nice-to-haves (link building, advanced schema) can wait. Focus on the 80/20: 20% of tasks (FAQ schema, question articles, monitoring) deliver 80% of results.

### **Can I hire someone to execute this checklist for me?**

Yes. Freelancers on Upwork charge RM500-1,500/month to execute. Or hire an agency (RM1,200-3,000/month) for professional execution with better tools and experience. This checklist is what agencies execute, just DIY-ified.

### **What happens after Day 90?**

Assess results. If you have 400-600 citations and positive ROI, continue with maintenance mode (2-3 hours/month). If results are weak, audit strategy (maybe targeting wrong queries) or hire professional help. Day 90 is decision point, not finish line.
