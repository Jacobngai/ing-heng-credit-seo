## **Direct Answer: How to Attribute AEO Revenue**

AEO revenue attribution uses a multi-touch approach combining citation tracking, call tracking, and CRM data to connect AI Overview appearances to closed deals. While zero-click searches complicate traditional last-click attribution, businesses can achieve 70-80% attribution accuracy by tracking brand mentions from AI answers, monitoring branded search increases, and using lead source questions. Expect 15-30% of organic revenue to come from AI-referred traffic within 6 months of AEO implementation.

---

## [The Attribution Problem](#the-attribution-problem)

**Zero-click searches = invisible revenue.**

Google's AI Overviews show up to 74% zero-click rates according to 2025 data. Users get answers directly in search results without visiting websites. Traditional analytics miss this traffic entirely.

**The problem:** A construction equipment rental company in KL sees 40% drop in organic clicks but 25% increase in inbound calls. Google Analytics shows declining traffic. CFO questions the RM1,200/month AEO investment.

**Reality:** The AEO campaign is working. AI Overviews are positioning the brand as the authority. Users search the brand name directly (branded search up 180%). They call instead of clicking website forms.

**The math:**
- 1,500 AI Overview appearances/month
- 450 zero-click impressions (30%)
- 135 branded searches follow (30% of zero-click)
- 27 calls convert (20% conversion)
- RM50,000 average deal size
- **RM270,000 in attributed revenue**

Missing this = killing AEO budget prematurely.

## [AEO Attribution Framework](#aeo-attribution-framework)

### 4-Tier Attribution Model

**Tier 1: Citation Tracking (40% weight)**
- Track AI Overview appearances for target queries
- Monitor citation frequency and positioning
- Measure share of voice in AI answers

**Tier 2: Branded Search Lift (25% weight)**
- Branded search volume increase post-AEO
- Direct traffic correlation with AI appearances
- Position 1-3 branded rankings (you should own these anyway)

**Tier 3: Assisted Conversions (20% weight)**
- Touchpoints in multi-conversion paths
- Email clicks from AI-sourced leads
- Return visitors from AI-referred traffic

**Tier 4: Direct Attribution (15% weight)**
- Click-throughs from AI Overviews
- Call tracking from AI-sourced searches
- Form submissions with "AI search" lead source

---

### The Attribution Formula

```
Total AEO Revenue = (Citations × Branded Search Rate × Conversion Rate × Avg Deal Size) + Direct Conversions
```

**Real example:**
- 1,200 AI Overview citations/month
- 28% branded search lift
- 18% lead-to-customer rate
- RM5,000 average project value

**Calculation:**
(1,200 × 0.28 × 0.18 × RM5,000) + (45 direct conversions × RM5,000)
= RM302,400 + RM225,000
= **RM527,400 monthly attributed revenue**

## **FAQ: AEO Revenue Attribution**

### **How accurate is AEO revenue attribution?**

70-80% accuracy is achievable with proper tracking. The remaining 20-30% represents truly unknown touchpoints, but that's far better than traditional analytics which miss 100% of zero-click AI traffic.

### **What if I don't have call tracking?**

You'll lose 40-60% of attribution data. Minimum viable setup: CRM lead source tracking + manual "How did you hear about us?" questions + branded search monitoring in GA4.

### **How long until AEO shows attributed revenue?**

First direct conversions appear in 30-45 days. Full attribution picture (including assisted revenue) emerges by month 3-4. Don't judge AEO ROI before 90 days.

### **Should I count branded searches as AEO revenue?**

Only the lift above baseline. If you normally get 500 branded searches/month and AEO drives it to 800, attribute 300 searches (60% lift) to AEO efforts, not the full 800.

### **What's a good AEO attribution rate?**

Top performers achieve 40-50% of total organic revenue attributed to AEO within 6 months. Average businesses see 20-30%. B2B with longer sales cycles see lower initial attribution (15-20%) but higher deal sizes.
