## **Converting Aircond Leads**

### Mobile Optimization for Service Inquiries

**82% of aircond service searches happen on mobile**. Someone sweating in their home isn't opening a laptop.

**Your mobile site must have:**
1. **Click-to-call button** prominent above the fold
2. **WhatsApp button** (preferred by 60% of Malaysians)
3. **Service areas** clearly listed (suburbs you cover)
4. **Pricing table** (transparency builds trust)
5. **Before/after photos** of your cleaning work
6. **Instant quote request** form

### Pricing Transparency Wins Customers

Aircond service customers **hate hidden fees**. Display pricing upfront to double your conversion rate.

**Example Pricing Table:**
```
Standard Cleaning (1 unit): RM80
- Filter cleaning
- Indoor unit wipe down
- Gas pressure check

Chemical Cleaning (1 unit): RM180
- Full chemical wash

Annual Maintenance Contract: RM600/year

```

### Service Contract Conversion Strategy

**Turn one-time jobs into recurring contracts:**

**Step 1:** Deliver exceptional one-time service
- Arrive on time (text when 30 min away)
- Wear shoe covers (protect their home)
- Before/after photos (show your work)
- Follow-up call (ensure satisfaction)

**Step 2:** Make contract offer immediately
- "Save RM150/year with our maintenance plan"
- "Priority service + 15% repair discount"
- "We'll remind you when it's time for servicing"

**Step 3:** Easy sign-up
- WhatsApp contract agreement
- Monthly auto-debit option (RM50/month)
- No long-term lock-in (cancel anytime)

**Conversion Rate Impact:**

## **Building Recurring Revenue with SEO**

### The Lifetime Value (LTV) Math

**One-Time Cleaning Customer:**
- Job value: RM120
- Frequency: Once per year
- Customer lifespan: 2 years
- **Total LTV: RM240**

**Maintenance Contract Customer:**
- Annual value: RM600
- Plus repairs: RM200/year average
- Customer lifespan: 3+ years
- **Total LTV: RM2,400+**

**10x difference in customer value.**

SEO helps you attract **contract-minded customers** (people planning long-term, not emergency fixes).

### Commercial vs. Residential Focus

**Commercial aircond = Higher revenue, fewer customers**

**Commercial keywords:**
- "office aircond maintenance" - 500 searches/month
- "commercial aircond service" - 800 searches/month
- "shop aircond servicing" - 300 searches/month
- "restaurant aircond cleaning" - 200 searches/month

**Commercial contract values:**
- Small office (3-5 units): RM2,000-4,000/year
- Restaurant (5-10 units): RM5,000-12,000/year
- Factory/warehouse: RM15,000-50,000/year
- Shopping mall: RM100,000+/year

**SEO Strategy:**
- Create separate landing pages for commercial
- Highlight case studies of commercial clients
- Emphasize "after-hours service" (businesses close at night)
- Show photos of commercial work (not just homes)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### How long does aircond service SEO take?

**2-3 months** for local keywords like "aircond service [your area]". Competitive keywords like "aircond service Kuala Lumpur" take **4-6 months**. Maintenance contract keywords convert faster (lower competition).

### Should I target residential or commercial aircond services?

**Both.** Create separate pages on your website. Commercial has higher value per customer but fewer leads. Residential has more volume but lower contract value. Diversify for stability.

### Can I rank for aircond keywords in multiple languages?

**Absolutely.** 40% of Malaysians prefer searching in Malay or Chinese. We create content in EN/ZH/MS. Your website automatically serves the right language based on user preference.

### Do I need to show pricing on my website?

**Highly recommended.** Aircond customers hate "call for pricing" responses. Transparent pricing doubles conversion rates. You can show ranges (e.g., "RM80-150 depending on unit type") if exact pricing varies.
