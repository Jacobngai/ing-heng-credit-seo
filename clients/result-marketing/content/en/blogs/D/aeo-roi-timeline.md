## **Summary: Real AEO Timelines**

**Key Takeaways:**
- Month 1-2: Investment phase (negative ROI). Setting up schema, content, earning citations.
- Month 3-4: Break-even point. First AI Overview appearances, first leads from AI answers.
- Month 6-12: Scale phase. 300-800% ROI as AI citations compound.
- Most businesses quit too early. 60% stop by Month 2, missing the exponential curve.

## The AEO ROI Reality Check

**Here's what nobody tells you about AEO:**

The first 60 days are pure investment. You're paying RM1,200/month, and you see zero direct revenue.

**But here's what's happening behind the scenes:**
- Google is indexing your new schema markup
- AI engines are learning your brand exists
- Content is being created and optimized
- First citations are appearing in AI answers

**By Month 3, the compound effect kicks in.**

Most Malaysian SMEs expect Google Ads speed (instant results). AEO is an asset-building strategy. You're planting trees, not buying fruit.

## Month-by-Month Breakdown

### **Month 1: Setup & Foundation**

**What happens:**
- Schema markup installation (Organization, FAQ, Article schemas)
- Content audit and optimization
- Keyword research for AI answers
- Technical SEO fixes (page speed, mobile optimization)

**What you see:**
- Zero AI Overview appearances
- Zero leads from AI answers
- Revenue: RM0
- ROI: -100% (you paid RM1,200, earned RM0)

**Behind the scenes:**
- Google re-indexing your pages with schema
- AI engines discovering your structured data
- Foundation for future citations

---

### **Month 2: Early Citations**

**What happens:**
- First AI Overview appearances (2-5 keywords)
- Early ChatGPT/Copilot mentions
- Content optimization iterations

**What you see:**
- 5-10 AI Overview impressions
- 1-3 leads from AI answers
- Revenue: RM500-1,500
- ROI: -50% to -25%

**Example (Locksmith business):**
- AI Overview impressions: 8
- Leads from AI answers: 2
- Converted jobs: 1 × RM250 = RM250
- ROI: (250 - 1,200) ÷ 1,200 × 100 = **-79%**

**Most businesses panic here.** They think "AEO doesn't work."

---

### **Month 3: The Tipping Point**

**What happens:**
- AI Overview appearances: 8-15 keywords
- First consistent leads from AI answers
- Conversion rate improves as targeting refines

**What you see:**
- 15-30 AI Overview impressions
- 8-15 leads from AI answers
- Revenue: RM2,500-4,500
- ROI: 100% to 275%

**Example (Construction equipment rental):**
- AI Overview keywords: 12
- Leads: 15
- Closed deals: 4 × RM3,000 = RM12,000
- ROI: (12,000 - 1,200) ÷ 1,200 × 100 = **900%**

**This is when most businesses go "Oh, NOW I get it."**

> **💡 Don't Quit at Month 2**
>
> Every month you wait: 3 competitors start AEO campaigns. They're capturing the spots you gave up on.

---

### **Month 4-6: Growth Phase**

**What happens:**
- AI Overview appearances: 20-40 keywords
- Compound effect (citations beget more citations)
- Brand recognition in AI answers

**What you see:**
- 40-80 AI Overview impressions/month
- 20-40 leads/month
- Revenue: RM6,000-15,000
- ROI: 400% to 1,150%

**Example (Aircond service business) - Month 6:**
- AI Overview keywords: 35
- Leads: 32
- Closed jobs: 13 × RM350 = RM4,550
- ROI: (4,550 - 1,200) ÷ 1,200 × 100 = **279%**

**Key insight:** Month 4-6 is when referrals start. People saw you in AI answers 2 months ago, remembered your brand, and now they're calling.

---

### **Month 6-12: Scale Phase**

**What happens:**
- AI Overview appearances: 50-100+ keywords
- Dominance in your niche's AI answers
- Predictable, scalable lead flow

**What you see:**
- 100+ AI Overview impressions/month
- 50-80 leads/month
- Revenue: RM15,000-40,000
- ROI: 1,150% to 3,230%

**Example (Crane rental business) - Month 12:**
- AI Overview keywords: 87
- Leads: 72
- Closed deals: 22 × RM4,000 = RM88,000
- ROI: (88,000 - 1,200) ÷ 1,200 × 100 = **7,233%**

**This is the asset phase.** You're now dominating AI answers in your industry. Stopping AEO would mean losing this dominant position.

---

## Why Month 1-2 Lose Money

**Three reasons AEO takes 60+ days:**

### 1. Google's Re-Indexing Cycle

**The reality:**
- Google doesn't instantly index schema changes
- Re-indexing takes 2-6 weeks
- AI engines need time to discover and trust new structured data

**What's happening:**
```
Day 1-14: Google crawls your schema
Day 15-30: Google processes and validates schema
Day 31-45: AI engines start testing your content in answers
Day 46-60: First AI Overview appearances
```

---

### 2. Content Optimization Iterations

**The process:**
- Month 1: Publish foundational content, schema, FAQs
- Month 2: Analyze what's working, optimize underperforming pages
- Month 3: Double down on winning topics, expand reach

**Most businesses underestimate content optimization.** You need 3-4 iterations to find the winning formula.

---

### 3. AI Engine Trust Building

**AI engines don't trust new brands immediately.**

They need to see:
- Consistent schema markup across all pages
- Regular content updates (not just set-and-forget)
- Brand mentions across the web (digital PR, backlinks)
- Positive user signals (click-through rates, time on site)

**This trust takes 6-8 weeks to build.**

---

## The Month 3-4 Turning Point

**What changes in Month 3-4?**

### 1. Citation Threshold Crossed

**The rule of 10:**
Once you appear in AI answers for 10+ keywords, the algorithm starts recommending you more often.

**Why:** AI engines see consistent citation signals and boost your authority.

---

### 2. Brand Recognition Kicks In

**The delayed effect:**
- Month 1: 1,000 people see your brand in AI answers
- Month 2: 2,500 people see your brand
- Month 3: 5,000 people see your brand + **referrals start**

**Most Month 3 leads say:** "I saw you in Google's AI answer last month..."

---

### 3. Conversion Rate Improves

**Month 1-2:** 10-20% conversion rate (still testing messaging)
**Month 3-4:** 25-40% conversion rate (optimized messaging)

**Result:** Same traffic, 2x more revenue.

---

## Month 6-12: Exponential Growth

**The compound effect of AEO:**

| Month | AI Overview Keywords | Leads | Revenue | ROI |
|-------|---------------------|-------|---------|-----|
| Month 1 | 0 | 0 | RM0 | -100% |
| Month 2 | 4 | 3 | RM750 | -37% |
| Month 3 | 12 | 8 | RM3,200 | 167% |
| Month 6 | 35 | 28 | RM11,200 | 833% |
| Month 9 | 58 | 47 | RM18,800 | 1,467% |
| Month 12 | 87 | 72 | RM28,800 | 2,300% |

**The curve:**
- Month 1-2: Flat (investment)
- Month 3-4: Linear growth
- Month 5-12: Exponential growth

**Most businesses quit before Month 3.** They never see the exponential curve.

## **FAQ: AEO ROI Timeline**

### **Can I speed up the AEO timeline?**

Partially. You can accelerate by: 1) Investing more in content production (RM2,000-3,000/month instead of RM1,200), 2) Running Google Ads simultaneously (capture immediate traffic while building AEO), 3) Aggressive digital PR (get brand mentions faster). However, Google's indexing cycle (2-6 weeks) is fixed. You can't cheat that.

### **What if I see NO results by Month 4?**

Something is wrong. Common causes: 1) Wrong keywords (low search volume), 2) Poor schema implementation (Google can't read your markup), 3) Weak content (AI engines don't cite low-quality content), 4) Technical issues (page speed, mobile errors). Request an audit from your AEO agency or switch providers.

### **Is Month 3 too late to start AEO?**

No. AEO is still emerging. Most businesses don't understand it yet. Starting in Month 3 of 2026 means you're ahead of 90% of competitors. The AI search revolution is just beginning. Early adopters now will dominate AI answers for years.

### **Do seasonal businesses have different timelines?**

Yes. Seasonal businesses (e.g., aircond servicing peaks in hot months) should start AEO 2-3 months BEFORE peak season. If your peak is May, start AEO in February. By May, you'll be in Month 3-4 and ready to capture peak demand.

### **Should I stop AEO in slow months?**

No. AEO builds cumulative authority. Stopping for 1-2 months loses momentum. AI engines may deprioritize your content if they see inconsistent updates. Better to reduce scope (e.g., RM800/month instead of RM1,200) than stop completely.
