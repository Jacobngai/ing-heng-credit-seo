## Why We Offer This

### Most Agencies Don't Offer Trials

**Why?**
- They don't believe in their results
- They need upfront payment
- Their sales cycle is long (3-6 months to convince you)
- They're afraid you'll cancel after seeing slow results

### Why We Offer RM399 Trials

**Reason 1: We Know SEO Works**

We've seen it 100+ times across industries:
- Construction equipment rental: 300% traffic increase in 6 months
- Vehicle dealers: 500% more leads in 12 months
- Emergency services: 200 calls/month from SEO in 90 days
- Local retail: 80% of revenue from SEO leads

SEO works when done right. We're confident.

**Reason 2: We Want to Prove It First**

**Traditional agency approach:**
- Promise results
- Ask for RM5,000-10,000 upfront
- 12-month contract
- You're stuck for a year even if results are poor

**Our approach:**
- RM399 trial (low risk for you)
- 30 days to see if it works
- If you see improvement → continue at RM1200/month
- If no results → full refund, keep the website

**We earn your business with results, not contracts.**

**Reason 3: Volume Game**

**The math:**
- 70% of trial clients continue to RM1200/month
- Average client stays 18+ months
- Client lifetime value: RM21,600
- We lose money on trials that don't convert
- We make it back on long-term clients

**Everyone wins:**
- You: Low-risk way to test SEO
- Us: Long-term clients who stay because SEO works
