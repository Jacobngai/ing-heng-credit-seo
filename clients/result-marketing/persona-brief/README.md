## Important: Compound vs. Granular Strategy

**COMPOUND Strategy (Recommended):**
- 10-15 sub-industries per industry
- Broader categories easier to manage
- Example: "Dentist" = 1 subcategory (not separate implants, root canal, etc.)
- Example: "Private Schools & International Schools" = 1 compound category

**GRANULAR Strategy (Previous):**
- 30-40+ sub-industries per industry
- Too detailed, difficult to manage
- Used in: Home Services document

**Going Forward:** All new industry research should use COMPOUND strategy.
