## "We Guarantee #1 Rankings in 30 Days!" (And Other Lies)

If you run a business in Malaysia, you’ve probably received the email. You know the one:

> *"Dear Sir/Madam, we analyzed your website and found many errors. We can get you to #1 on Google for only RM500/month."*

It sounds tempting. But here is the hard truth that most "digital marketing agencies" won't tell you: **SEO is not a commodity.** It’s not like buying nasi lemak where RM2 gets you a basic packet and RM10 gets you ayam goreng.

In SEO, "cheap" almost always means "dangerous."

At Result Marketing, we spend half our time fixing the mess left behind by cheap agencies. We’ve seen sites penalized, de-indexed, and completely ruined by "guaranteed" services.

Before you sign that contract, here are the 5 massive red flags you need to watch out for.

## Red Flag #1: The "Guaranteed Rankings" Promise

**The Pitch:** "We guarantee page 1 ranking for 5 keywords in 3 months or your money back."

**The Reality:** No one owns Google. Not even Google employees can guarantee a ranking. The algorithm changes 4,000+ times a year.

**Why It’s a Scam:** Agencies that promise this usually do one of two things:
1.  **Rank you for useless keywords:** Yay, you're #1 for "best pink rubber spatula manufacturer in Cheras South." Nobody searches for that. Your traffic is zero.
2.  **Use Black Hat tactics:** They spam your site with low-quality links to force a temporary spike. It works for 2 months, then Google catches you and bans your site. The agency disappears; you're left with a dead domain.

**The "Result Marketing" Standard:** We promise *work*, not *rankings*. We guarantee deliverables (content, technical fixes, links) and forecast growth based on data, but we never lie about controlling the algorithm.

## Red Flag #2: "Proprietary Secret Methodology"

**The Pitch:** "We use our secret AI-quantum-sauce algorithm that no one else has."

**The Reality:** SEO isn't magic. It’s physics. It’s transparent.

**Why It’s a Scam:** If they won't tell you *what* they are doing, it's because they aren't doing anything. We've audited client sites where the previous agency charged RM3,000/month for "maintenance" and didn't log into the website *once* in 6 months.

**What to Ask Instead:** "Can I see your monthly report template?" If it doesn't list exactly what tasks were completed (e.g., "Created 4 blog posts," "Fixed 12 404 errors"), run away.

## Red Flag #3: The "RM500/Month" Package

**The Pitch:** "Affordable SEO for small businesses! Only RM500!"

**The Reality:** Let’s do the math. A good SEO article takes 4-6 hours to research, write, and optimize. A decent backlink costs time or money to acquire. A technical audit takes expert hours.

At RM500/month, the agency has about 3 hours of budget for you. What can they possibly achieve in 3 hours?

**The Consequence:** Cheap SEO is usually automated. They use software to spin garbage content and blast spammy links. It hurts your brand more than doing nothing.

---

## Red Flag #4: They Don't Ask About Your Business

**The Scenario:** You get on a call, and they immediately start talking about "meta tags" and "backlinks" without asking:
- What is your highest-margin product?
- Who is your ideal customer?
- What is the lifetime value of a lead?

**The Problem:** Ranking for "traffic" is vanity. Ranking for **revenue** is sanity.

If an agency doesn't understand *how you make money*, they will optimize for the wrong things. We once saw a luxury interior design firm ranking for "cheap DIY home decor tips." They got 10,000 visitors a month. Zero sales. Wrong intent.

---

## Red Flag #5: The Long-Term Lock-In Contract

**The Pitch:** "You must sign a 12-month contract because SEO takes time."

**The Reality:** Yes, SEO takes time (usually 3-6 months for traction). But an agency confident in their work shouldn't need to hold you hostage.

**Our Approach:** We work on rolling 3-month sprints. We earn your business every quarter. If we aren't delivering value, you should be free to fire us. (Spoiler: No one leaves).

## So, How Do You Choose?

Look for a partner, not a vendor. Look for transparency. Look for someone who says "I don't know" when they don't know, and "Here is the data" when they do.

**The Checklist for Hiring:**
1.  **Ask for Case Studies:** Not logos, but stories. "Show me a client where things went wrong and how you fixed it."
2.  **Ask Who Does the Work:** Is it the expert you're talking to, or is it outsourced to a freelancer you'll never meet?
3.  **Ask About Reporting:** Will you see traffic? Or leads? (Hint: You can't pay rent with traffic).

## Ready for an Honest Conversation?

We don't sell packages. We build growth engines.

If you want to know if SEO is actually right for your business (sometimes it’s not!), let’s have a chat. No sales pitch, no "guarantees," just a look at your data and a roadmap of what's possible.
