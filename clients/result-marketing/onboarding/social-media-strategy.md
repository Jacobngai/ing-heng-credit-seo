## Content Repurposing Strategy (Maximize ROI)

Create once, distribute everywhere:

- 1 Twitter Thread (summary with CTA to read full article)
- 1 Instagram Carousel (later, when active)
- 1 YouTube Video Script (later)
- 1 Email Newsletter Section

**Example Workflow:**
1. Write comprehensive blog post: "Complete Guide to Long-Tail Keywords"
2. Break into sections:
   - Section 1: What are long-tail keywords? → LinkedIn Post #1
   - Section 2: Why they matter → LinkedIn Post #2
   - Section 3: How to find them → LinkedIn Post #3
   - Section 4: Case study → LinkedIn Post #4
   - Section 5: Common mistakes → LinkedIn Post #5
3. Pull best quotes for tweets
4. Create carousel with key stats for LinkedIn
5. Film YouTube video explaining the guide (later)

**AI Repurposing Prompt:**
"Take this 2,000-word blog post and create:
- 5 LinkedIn posts (300 words each)
- 10 tweets (280 characters each)
- 1 Twitter thread (8-10 tweets)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Posting without engaging:** Social media is social - 50% content, 50% engagement
2. **Being too promotional:** 80% value, 20% promotion (not the reverse)
3. **Inconsistency:** Better to post 3x/week consistently than 10x one week and 0x the next
4. **Ignoring comments:** Reply to every comment within 24 hours
5. **No clear CTA:** Every post should have a next step (comment, DM, download, visit website)
6. **Copying competitors:** Be authentic, share your unique POV
7. **Giving up too soon:** Takes 3-6 months to build momentum
8. **Not tracking results:** What gets measured gets improved
