## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: Keyword Direction

**NEVER generate these wrong keywords for equipment rental clients:**
- ❌ "[INDUSTRY] SEO" (e.g., "forklift rental SEO", "lorry rental SEO")
- ❌ "marketing for [INDUSTRY]" (e.g., "marketing for forklift rental")
- ❌ "digital marketing for [INDUSTRY]"
- ❌ "[SERVICE] for [INDUSTRY]" (e.g., "SEO for construction companies")

**These target BUSINESSES wanting marketing help, NOT CUSTOMERS wanting equipment!**

**ALWAYS generate customer-facing keywords instead:**
- ✅ "[SERVICE] rental [location]" (e.g., "forklift rental Klang")
- ✅ "[SERVICE] hire [location]" (e.g., "excavator hire Selangor")
- ✅ "how much to rent [SERVICE]" (e.g., "how much to rent lorry")
- ✅ "[SERVICE] rental price per day"
- ✅ "best [SERVICE] for [USE CASE]" (e.g., "best forklift for warehouse")

**Think:** What does a CUSTOMER type into ChatGPT when they need equipment? NOT "how do I market my forklift business?"

## 1. Problem: Expensive Marketing That Doesn't Convert

[PARAGRAPH 1: Describe the pain point - businesses spending too much on ads]

[TARGET AUDIENCE] in Malaysia are spending [AMOUNT]/month on [ALTERNATIVE], but most aren't seeing results. Here's why:

- **Problem 1:** [EXPLAIN PROBLEM - e.g., Facebook ads target browsers, not buyers]
- **Problem 2:** [EXPLAIN PROBLEM - e.g., Google Ads CPC keeps rising]
- **Problem 3:** [EXPLAIN PROBLEM - e.g., No long-term asset buildup]

[PARAGRAPH 2: Concrete example with numbers]

A typical [TARGET AUDIENCE] spends:
- [AMOUNT]/month on Facebook Ads = [NUMBER] leads at RM[NUMBER]/lead
- [AMOUNT]/month on Google Ads = [NUMBER] leads at RM[NUMBER]/lead

Total cost: [TOTAL AMOUNT]/month for [TOTAL LEADS] leads

That's expensive. And when you stop paying, the leads stop immediately.

---

## 2. [SERVICE]: The Smarter Alternative

[DEFINE SERVICE clearly in 1-2 sentences]

[SERVICE] is [DEFINITION - what it is, how it works].

**Why [SERVICE] works for [TARGET AUDIENCE]:**

1. **[BENEFIT 1]:** [EXPLAIN - e.g., Captures buyer intent, not browsers]
2. **[BENEFIT 2]:** [EXPLAIN - e.g., Long-term compounding returns]
3. **[BENEFIT 3]:** [EXPLAIN - e.g., 3-language reach (EN/ZH/MS)]

[PARAGRAPH: How it works technically]

With [SERVICE], we optimize your website for keywords like:
- "[KEYWORD EXAMPLE 1]"
- "[KEYWORD EXAMPLE 2]"
- "[KEYWORD EXAMPLE 3]"

When people search these terms, your website appears at the top. They click, they call, you close the sale.

---

## 3. Cost Comparison: [SERVICE] vs [ALTERNATIVE]

Let's compare the numbers over [TIMEFRAME, e.g., 12 months]:

| Metric | [SERVICE] | [ALTERNATIVE] | Difference |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Monthly Cost | RM[SERVICE PRICE] | RM[ALT PRICE] | RM[DIFFERENCE] |
| Annual Cost | RM[SERVICE ANNUAL] | RM[ALT ANNUAL] | RM[DIFFERENCE] |
| Avg Leads/Month | [SERVICE LEADS] | [ALT LEADS] | [LEAD DIFF] |
| Cost Per Lead | RM[SERVICE CPL] | RM[ALT CPL] | RM[CPL DIFF] |
| Long-term Asset? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | - |

**[SERVICE] saves you RM[SAVINGS]/year.**

But more importantly, you own the asset. Stop paying for [SERVICE], and the leads keep coming (for a while). Stop paying for [ALTERNATIVE], and leads stop immediately.

---

## 4. Real Results from [TARGET AUDIENCE]

Don't just take our word for it. Here's what [TARGET AUDIENCE] are experiencing:

**Case Study: [CLIENT NAME] from [INDUSTRY]**

- **Before [SERVICE]:** Spending RM[BEFORE AMOUNT]/month on [ALTERNATIVE], getting [BEFORE LEADS] leads/month
- **After [SERVICE]:** Spending RM[AFTER AMOUNT]/month, getting [AFTER LEADS] leads/month
- **Result:** [RESULT - e.g., 60% cost reduction, 3x more leads]
