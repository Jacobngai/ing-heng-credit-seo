# Banks Want 10% Down. We Want 0% Down.

## What is Down Payment?

Down payment is money you pay first. Before you get your equipment.

Banks ask you to pay 10-20% down. This is a lot of money.

Let us say you want to buy a used CAT excavator. It costs RM 50,000.

Bank says: "Pay 10% down first. That is RM 5,000."

Bank says: "Or pay 20% down. That is RM 10,000."

Do you have RM 5,000 or RM 10,000? Many people do not have this money ready.

## The Problem with Down Payment

Down payment stops many people from getting equipment.

You have work. You have customers. You can pay monthly. But you do not have big money now.

This is why people cannot grow their business. They wait years to save down payment.
