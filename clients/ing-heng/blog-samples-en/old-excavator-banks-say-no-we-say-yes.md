# Old Excavator? Banks Say No. We Say Yes.

## The Story of Mr. Tan

Mr. Tan is a contractor. He has a small construction company.

He found a good deal. A 10-year-old Komatsu excavator. The price? Only RM 35,000.

The machine works well. The owner took care of it. It can dig for many more years.

Mr. Tan went to the bank. He wanted to get a loan.

## The Bank Said No

The bank officer looked at the excavator.

"How old is this?" the officer asked.

"Ten years old," Mr. Tan said.

"Sorry," the officer said. "We cannot finance this. It is too old. Our rule is 5 years maximum."

Mr. Tan was sad. The excavator was a good machine. The price was good. But the bank said no.

## Why Banks Say No

Banks have strict rules. They think:

- Old equipment might break down
- Old equipment has less value
- Old equipment is risky

So they make a rule: No equipment older than 5 years.

But this rule is not fair. Many old machines work very well.

## Ing Heng Says Yes

Mr. Tan came to Ing Heng Credit.

He showed us the 10-year-old Komatsu excavator.

"Yes," we said. "We can finance this. No problem."

We do not care about age. We care about:

- Does the machine work?
- Can it make money?
- Is the price fair?

If the answer is yes, we say yes.
