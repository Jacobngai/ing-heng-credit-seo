# Used Forklift for RM 15,000 - Yes, We Finance It

## A Great Deal

Raj works in a warehouse. He needs a forklift.

He found a used forklift. The price? Only RM 15,000.

It is not new. But it works well. It can lift pallets. It can move goods.

Raj was excited. This forklift could help his business. It could make work faster.

## The Bank Problem

Raj went to the bank. He wanted a loan for the RM 15,000 forklift.

The bank asked questions:

- "How old is the forklift?"
- "What brand is it?"
- "Do you have 10% down payment?"

The forklift was 7 years old. It was not a famous brand.

And Raj did not have RM 1,500 for down payment.

The bank said: "Sorry. We cannot approve this loan."

## Why Banks Refuse

Banks are picky about small equipment. They think:

- Small loans are not worth the work
- Old forklifts are too risky
- Unknown brands are not valuable
- Down payment must be paid

So many small business owners cannot get financing.

## Ing Heng Says Yes

Raj came to Ing Heng Credit.

He showed us the forklift. RM 15,000. Used. 7 years old.

"Yes," we said. "We can finance this."

We do not care about:
- Small loan amounts
- Older equipment
- Unknown brands
- No down payment

We care about: Can this forklift help your business?
