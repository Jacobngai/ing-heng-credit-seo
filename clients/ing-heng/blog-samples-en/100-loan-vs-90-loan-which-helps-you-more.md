# 100% Loan vs 90% Loan - Which Helps You More?

## What Do These Numbers Mean?

When you finance equipment, the lender gives you a loan. This loan pays for the machine.

**100% Loan**
- Lender pays the full price
- You pay nothing down
- All money goes to equipment

**90% Loan**
- Lender pays most of the price
- You pay 10% down
- You need cash upfront

## Example: Buying a Used Excavator

Let us say you want to buy a used CAT excavator. The price is RM 50,000.

**With 90% Loan (Bank)**
- Equipment price: RM 50,000
- Bank loan: RM 45,000 (90%)
- Your down payment: RM 5,000 (10%)
- You need cash: RM 5,000 NOW

**With 100% Loan (Ing Heng)**
- Equipment price: RM 50,000
- Ing Heng loan: RM 50,000 (100%)
- Your down payment: RM 0 (0%)
- You need cash: RM 0 NOW

## The Difference is RM 5,000

RM 5,000 is a lot of money.

What can you do with RM 5,000?

- Buy diesel for 2 weeks
- Pay 2 workers for 1 month
- Buy spare parts
- Pay office rent
- Keep as emergency cash

When you use Ing Heng, you keep your RM 5,000.

## Why 100% Loan Helps More

**Preserve Cash Flow**
Cash is important for business. You need cash every day. For fuel. For workers. For parts.

If you pay RM 5,000 down, you lose this cash.

If you pay RM 0 down, you keep this cash.

**Start Faster**
With bank: You must save RM 5,000 first. This takes time.

With Ing Heng: Start now. No waiting.

**Better For Small Business**
Small businesses need cash. Big down payments hurt. Small down payments help.

100% loan = 0% down = Keep your cash

## Compare Interest Rates

Banks charge 4.6% to 6.0% per year.

Ing Heng charges competitive rates.

Is the bank rate lower? Maybe. But look at the full picture.

**Bank:**
- Rate: 4.6% per year
- Down payment: RM 5,000 lost
- Loan: 90% only

**Ing Heng:**
- Rate: Competitive
- Down payment: RM 0
- Loan: 100%

The small rate difference does not matter. Because you keep your cash with Ing Heng.

## The Real Cost

Let us count the real cost.

**Bank (90% loan):**
- Interest: 4.6% on RM 45,000
- Down payment lost: RM 5,000
- Opportunity cost: What you could do with RM 5,000

**Ing Heng (100% loan):**
- Interest: Competitive rate on RM 50,000
- Down payment lost: RM 0
- Opportunity cost: RM 0

You keep RM 5,000 working for your business. This is worth more than a small rate difference.

## Which Helps You More?

Ask yourself:

1. Do you have RM 5,000 to RM 10,000 cash now?
2. Do you want to keep your cash for operations?
3. Do you want to start work faster?

If yes, 100% loan helps you more.
