# Banks Say 5 Years Max. We Say Any Age.

## The Big Problem with Banks

Banks have strict rules. They say your equipment cannot be older than 5 years. That is it. No more.

If your excavator is 6 years old, banks say "No."

If your forklift is 8 years old, banks say "No."

If your lorry is 10 years old, banks say "No."

This is a big problem. Good machines can last 15-20 years. But banks only want to give money for new or almost new equipment.

## What Ing Heng Does Different

Ing Heng Credit says YES to any age.

- 5 years old? Yes.
- 10 years old? Yes.
- 15 years old? Yes.
- 20 years old? Yes.

We do not have an age limit. If your equipment works, we can finance it.

## Why This Matters to You

Older equipment costs less money. A used Komatsu excavator starts at RM 34,000. A used CAT starts at RM 50,000.

These machines still work well. They can make you money. But banks will not help you buy them.

Ing Heng will help you buy them.

## Real Example

Ah Lim needs an excavator. He has RM 40,000 to spend.

He finds a good used Komatsu. It is 8 years old. It costs RM 38,000.

Bank says: "Sorry, too old. We cannot finance this."

Ing Heng says: "Yes, we can help. 0% down payment. 100% loan."

Ah Lim gets his excavator. He starts work. He makes money.

## The Choice is Clear

- Banks: 5 years max age limit
- Ing Heng: No age limit

- Banks: Say no to older equipment
- Ing Heng: Say yes to older equipment

- Banks: You miss good deals
- Ing Heng: You get good deals

## Conclusion

Do not let bank rules stop you. Older equipment can still make you money. Ing Heng understands this.

We finance equipment of any age. Because what matters is that the machine works. Not how old it is.

Call Ing Heng today. Get the equipment you need. No matter the age.
