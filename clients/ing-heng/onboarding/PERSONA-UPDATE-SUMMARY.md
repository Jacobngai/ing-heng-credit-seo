## Persona.md Fixes Applied

### ❌ REMOVED: Prohibited Messaging
All instances of specific approval timeframes removed:
- "2-hour approval" (8 instances) → "fast approval (faster than banks)"
- "2小时批准" (Chinese) → "快速批准"
- "48-hour approval" → "fast approval (faster than traditional banks)"

### ✅ ADDED: Compliant Messaging
- "Fast approval (much faster than banks' 2-4 weeks)"
- "Quick approval process"
- "Rapid response to applications"
- "Competitive approval timeframe"

**Why:** Actual approval takes 2-3 business days. Banks take 2-4 weeks. We're faster, but honest.
