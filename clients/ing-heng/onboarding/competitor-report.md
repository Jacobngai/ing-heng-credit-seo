## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the top 5 competitors in Malaysian equipment financing based on SERP rankings, online visibility, and market positioning. The analysis reveals significant opportunities for Ing Heng Credit to differentiate through:

1. **Content Gap Exploitation:** Competitors focus on corporate messaging; lack SME-specific, problem-solving content
