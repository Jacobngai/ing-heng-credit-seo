# Forklift Financing - Warehouse Expansion Tax Benefits 2026

## Banks Make Forklift Purchase Hard

When you need forklifts for warehouse expansion, banks require 10-20% down payment. They finance only 90% of the forklift value.

For 5 forklifts at RM 15,000 each (RM 75,000 total), banks want RM 7,500 to RM 15,000 down. This hurts your warehouse budget.

Banks also reject forklifts older than 5 years.

## Ing Heng Offers Full Forklift Financing

We provide forklift financing with 0% down payment. You get 100% full loan. No age limit on forklifts.

Our rates compete with bank rates of 4.6% to 6.0% per year.
