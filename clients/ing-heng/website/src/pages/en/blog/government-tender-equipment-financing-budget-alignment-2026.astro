# Government Tender Equipment Financing - Budget Alignment 2026

## Banks Don't Understand Government Tender Needs

When contractors win government tenders, banks still require 10-20% down payment. They don't align with project payment terms.

For equipment needed to fulfill RM 500,000 tender, banks want RM 50,000 to RM 100,000 down. This strains contractor cash flow.

Banks also reject equipment older than 5 years, limiting cost-effective options.

## Ing Heng Supports Government Tender Projects

We provide government tender equipment financing with 0% down payment. You get 100% full loan. Flexible terms aligned with project payments.

No age limit on equipment helps control costs.

## Comparison: Banks vs Ing Heng

|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Down Payment | 10-20% | 0% |
| Loan Amount | 90% | 100% |
| Equipment Age | Under 5 years | No limit |
| Project Terms | Rigid | Flexible |
