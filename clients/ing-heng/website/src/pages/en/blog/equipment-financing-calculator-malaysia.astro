// FAQ Data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How accurate is the financing calculator?',
    answer: 'Our calculator provides accurate estimates based on standard hire purchase formulas used in Malaysia. It calculates your monthly payment using the loan amount (equipment price minus down payment), interest rate, and loan tenure. However, final rates may vary based on your credit profile, equipment age, and specific lender terms. Use the calculator as a budgeting guide, then contact Ing Heng Credit for actual approval rates and exact payment amounts. We provide personalized quotes within 1 business day.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What factors affect my monthly payment?',
    answer: 'Four main factors affect monthly payment: (1) Equipment Price - Higher price means higher monthly payment. Every RM10,000 increase adds RM200-350 to monthly payment. (2) Down Payment - Larger down payment reduces loan amount and monthly cost. 30% down vs 10% down can save RM150-300/month. (3) Interest Rate - Lower rates reduce monthly payment. 1% rate reduction saves RM50-150/month on RM100,000 loan. (4) Loan Term - Longer term spreads payments over more months. 60-month vs 36-month term reduces monthly payment by 30-40% but costs more in total interest.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I choose a longer or shorter loan term?',
    answer: 'It depends on your cash flow and business goals: Choose Shorter Term (12-36 months) if: You have strong monthly cash flow. You want to pay less total interest (save 20-40%). You want to own equipment faster. You plan to sell or upgrade equipment soon. Choose Longer Term (48-60 months) if: You need lower monthly payments for cash flow. You are starting a new business with uncertain income. You want to preserve working capital. The equipment will last 10+ years. Example: RM200,000 excavator, 10% down, 9% interest: 36 months = RM5,738/month, RM26,568 total interest. 60 months = RM3,735/month, RM44,100 total interest. Savings: RM2,003/month but RM17,532 more interest over time.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between calculator results and actual approval?',
    answer: 'Calculator provides estimates. Actual approval may differ based on: (1) Credit Profile - Calculator assumes standard rates (7.5-12%). Your actual rate depends on credit score, payment history, and existing debt. Good credit = lower rate. Poor credit = higher rate. (2) Equipment Age - New equipment qualifies for best rates. Used equipment (5-10 years old) typically adds 1-3% to interest rate. (3) Insurance Requirements - Most lenders require equipment insurance. Insurance premium adds RM100-500/month to total cost. (4) Processing Fees - Some lenders charge 1-2% processing fee. Calculator does not include these fees. At Ing Heng Credit, we provide accurate quotes reflecting your actual approval terms. Use calculator for budgeting, then apply for exact payment amounts.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use the calculator for any equipment type?',
    answer: 'Yes! The calculator works for all types of business equipment: Construction Equipment - Excavators, bulldozers, cranes, concrete mixers, backhoes. Logistics Vehicles - Lorries (1-10 ton), prime movers, trailers, refrigerated trucks. Warehouse Equipment - Forklifts (electric/diesel), reach stackers, pallet jacks. Manufacturing Machinery - CNC machines, injection molding, lathes, presses. Food Equipment - Commercial ovens, refrigeration, food trucks. Just enter your equipment price and adjust settings. The calculation formula is the same for all equipment types. Interest rates may vary slightly by equipment category (construction equipment typically 7.5-10%, commercial vehicles 8-11%, specialized equipment 9-12%). Use the interest rate slider to test different scenarios.'

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
        <p>
          After you enter your information, the calculator shows three important numbers. Here's what each one means and why it matters for your business budget.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Monthly Payment</h3>
        <p>
          This is the amount you'll pay every month. It includes both principal (loan amount) and interest.
          Make sure this fits comfortably in your monthly cash flow. A good rule: monthly payment should not exceed 20% of your monthly revenue.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Total Interest Cost</h3>
        <p>
          This is the total interest you'll pay over the entire loan term. Lower interest rates and shorter loan terms reduce this amount.
          For example, a 36-month loan costs 30-40% less in total interest than a 60-month loan.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Total Amount Payable</h3>
        <p>
          This is your loan amount plus total interest. It's the complete cost of financing (not including down payment).
          Use this to calculate your total investment and compare against equipment ROI.
        </p>

        <div class="my-8 p-6 bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-500 rounded">
          <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Important Note:</p>
          <p>
            Calculator results are estimates only. Your actual approval amount and interest rate depend on your credit profile,
            equipment age, and lender assessment. Contact <a href="/en/contact" class="text-primary hover:text-primary-dark underline">Ing Heng Credit</a> for accurate quotes based on your specific situation.

  <!-- Factors That Affect Monthly Payment -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container-custom">
      <h2 class="section-title">What Affects Your Monthly Payment?</h2>

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
        <p>
          Four main factors determine your monthly payment amount. Understanding these helps you adjust your financing to fit your budget.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Equipment Price</h3>
        <p>
          Higher equipment price means higher monthly payment. For every RM 10,000 increase in price, expect monthly payment to increase by RM 200-350
          (depending on loan term and interest rate). Consider buying quality used equipment to reduce cost by 40-60%.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Down Payment Amount</h3>
        <p>
          Larger down payment reduces your loan amount and monthly payment. Paying 30% down instead of 10% can save you RM 150-300 per month.
          However, don't drain your working capital completely. Keep 3-6 months of operating expenses in reserve.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Interest Rate</h3>
        <p>
          Interest rate is based on your credit score, equipment age, and lender policy. In Malaysia, rates typically range from 7.5% to 12% per annum for equipment financing.
          Every 1% reduction in interest rate saves RM 50-150 per month on a RM 100,000 loan.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Loan Term Length</h3>
        <p>
          Longer loan terms spread payments over more months, reducing monthly cost but increasing total interest paid.
          Shorter terms mean higher monthly payment but less interest overall. Choose based on your cash flow and equipment lifespan.

        <h3>Factors That May Change Your Rate</h3>

        <h4>1. Credit Profile Review</h4>
        <p>
          The calculator uses a standard interest rate range (7.5-12% p.a.). Your actual rate depends on your credit score, payment history,
          and existing debt levels. Good credit history qualifies for lower rates. CCRIS issues or bankruptcy may increase rates by 1-3%.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Equipment Age and Condition</h4>
        <p>
          New equipment gets the best rates. Used equipment (5-10 years old) typically adds 1-3% to your interest rate.
          Very old equipment (10+ years) may require special approval or higher down payment. The calculator assumes standard equipment age.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Insurance Requirements</h4>
        <p>
          Most lenders require comprehensive equipment insurance. Insurance premium adds RM 100-500 per month to your total cost
          (depending on equipment value and coverage). The calculator does not include insurance costs in monthly payment.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Processing Fees and Charges</h4>
        <p>
          Some lenders charge processing fees (typically 1-2% of loan amount), stamp duty, or legal fees.
          These one-time costs are not included in the calculator but affect your initial investment.
