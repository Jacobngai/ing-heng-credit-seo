      <h2>The RM15/Trip Incentive: Government Pays You to Drive Off-Peak</h2>

      <p>Malaysia's highways are congested during peak hours. 6am-10am and 4pm-8pm: traffic jams, delays, frustration.</p>

      <p>The government's solution: incentivize heavy vehicles to drive during off-peak hours.</p>

      <p><strong>The Offer:</strong> RM15 per trip for prime movers entering major highways during off-peak hours (10pm-6am).</p>

      <p>For a prime operator making 300 trips monthly, that's RM4,500 in additional profit—purely for adjusting your schedule.</p>

      <h2>How the Off-Peak Incentive Works</h2>

      <h3>Program Details</h3>

      <p><strong>Eligible Vehicles:</strong>
      <br>• Prime movers (head trucks)
      <br>• Heavy lorries (5-ton and above)
      <br>• Trailers and container carriers</p>

      <p><strong>Eligible Highways:</strong>
      <br>• North-South Expressway (PLUS)
      <br>• AKLEH Highway
      <br>• KESAS Highway
      <br>• Other major highways (check latest list with JPJ)</p>

      <p><strong>Off-Peak Hours:</strong>
      <br>• Night: 10:00pm - 6:00am
      <br>• Incentive rate: RM15 per highway entry</p>

      <h3>Application Process</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Register with JPJ/LLM (Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia)
        <li>Install on-board unit (OBM) tracking device
        <li>Obtain off-peak vehicle sticker
        <li>Submit monthly trip logs
        <li>Receive incentive payment monthly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Profitability Math: Off-Peak Operations</h2>

      <h3>Revenue Impact Calculation</h3>

      <p><strong>Current Operations (Peak Hours Only):</strong>
      <br>• Trips per day: 2
      <br>• Revenue per trip: RM1,500
      <br>• Daily revenue: RM3,000
      <br>• Monthly revenue (25 days): RM75,000
      <br><strong>Off-Peak Incentive:</strong> RM0 (not participating)</p>

           <p><strong>Off-Peak Operations (Same 2 Trips, Adjusted Schedule):</strong>
      <br>• Trips per day: 2 (now 10pm-6am)
      <br>• Revenue per trip: RM1,500 (same rate)
      <br>• Daily revenue: RM3,000
      <br>• Monthly revenue (25 days): RM75,000
      <br><strong>Off-Peak Incentive:</strong> RM750/day (RM15 × 2 trips × 25 days)
      <br><strong>Monthly Bonus:</strong> RM18,750</p>

      <p><strong>Annual Bonus:</strong> RM225,000 additional profit</p>

      <h3>Additional Benefits Beyond RM15/Trip</h3>

      <p><strong>Fuel Savings:</strong>
      <br>• No traffic congestion = consistent speed
      <br>• Peak hours: stop-and-go driving increases fuel consumption 15-20%
      <br>• Off-peak: steady speed = optimal fuel efficiency
      <br><strong>Fuel Savings:</strong> RM500-RM1,000 monthly</p>

      <p><strong>Time Savings:</strong>
      <br>• Peak hours: 2 hours per trip (traffic delays)
      <br>• Off-peak: 1.5 hours per trip (clear roads)
      <br>• Time saved: 30 minutes per trip
      <br><strong>Result:</strong> Can fit 3 trips in same time (if demand exists) = RM1,500 additional revenue per day</p>

      <p><strong>Driver Benefits:</strong>
      <br>• Less stressful driving (no congestion frustration)
      <br>• Better sleep schedule (night operations)
      <br>• Higher driver retention</p>

      <h2>Financing Off-Peak Operations: What You Need</h2>

      <h3>OBU (On-Board Unit) Installation</h3>

      <p><strong>Required Equipment:</strong>
      <br>• GPS tracking device
      <br>• Highway entry detection sensor
      <br>• Data transmission unit
      <br><strong>Cost:</strong> RM2,000-RM3,500 per prime mover</p>

      <p><strong>Financing Solution:</strong>
      <br>• Include OBU in prime mover financing
      <br>• RM3,500 spread over 5-year term = RM70/month additional
      <br>• Off-peak incentive (RM750/month) more than covers OBU cost</p>

      <h3>Operational Adjustments</h3>

      <p>Off-peak operations require:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Night Dispatch:</strong> Dispatcher available 10pm-6am</li>
        <li><strong>Driver Availability:</strong> Drivers willing to work night shifts</li>
        <li><strong>Client Coordination:</strong> Wareports must accept late-night/early-morning deliveries</li>
        <li><strong>Port Access:</strong> Ports must allow off-peak container pickup/drop-off</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Additional Prime Movers for Peak/Off-Peak Split</h3>

      <p>Optimal strategy: Split fleet between peak and off-peak operations:</p>

      <p><strong>Example Fleet (10 Prime Movers):</strong>
      <br>• 6 prime movers: Peak hours (6am-10am, 4pm-8pm)
      <br>• 4 prime movers: Off-peak hours (10pm-6am)
      <br><strong>Incentive Earnings:</strong> 4 prime movers × 2 trips/day × RM15 × 25 days = RM3,000/month</p>

      <h2>Ing Heng Credit: Off-Peak Optimization Financing</h2>

      <h3>1. We Finance Complete Off-Peak Setup</h3>

      <p>We finance:
      <br>• Prime mover purchase
      <br>• OBU installation
      <br>• JPJ registration modifications
      <br>• Initial off-peak permit fees</p>

      <p><strong>Result:</strong> One monthly payment covers all off-peak requirements.</p>

      <h3>2. 0% Down Payment Accelerates Off-Peak Transition</h3>

      <p>Transitioning to off-peak operations requires:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>OBU equipment purchase: RM3,500 per prime mover
        <li>Driver night shift differential pay: +RM500/month per driver
        <li>Dispatcher night shift: Additional staff cost</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>0% Down Payment Benefit:</strong>
      <br>• Preserved capital covers transition costs
      <br>• Off-peak incentives (RM18,750/month) exceed transition costs within 2 months
      <br>• Profitability begins immediately</p>

      <h3>3. Flexible Terms for Seasonal Adjustments</h3>

      <p>Off-peak demand varies by season:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Festive periods: High demand (off-peak valuable)
        <li>Monsoon seasons: Reduced demand (may revert to peak operations)
        <li>Economic slowdowns: Port volumes drop (off-peak may be only option)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We offer:
      <br>• Seasonal payment adjustments
      <br>• Skip payments during low-volume months
      <br>• Balloon payments during high-volume months</p>

      <h3>4. Multiple Prime Mover Financing</h3>

      <p>Optimal off-peak/peak split requires multiple prime movers:</p>

      <p><strong>Example: 10 Prime Mover Fleet</strong>
      <br>• 4 off-peak dedicated: RM1.4 million
      <br>• 6 peak/off-peak flexible: RM2.1 million
      <br><strong>Total Investment:</strong> RM3.5 million</p>

      <p>We finance entire fleet with 0% down payment, bundle all OBU equipment, and structure payments to match off-peak revenue patterns.</p>

      <h2>Real-World Off-Peak Success Stories</h2>

      <h3>Port Klang Night Operations</h3>

      <p>\"Operated 6 prime movers on peak hours only. Constant congestion, wasted fuel, driver stress. Heard about RM15 off-peak incentive. Ing Heng financed 2 additional prime movers (0% down) dedicated to off-peak. Installed OBU on all 8 prime movers. Trained drivers for night shifts. Now 4 prime movers run off-peak, 4 remain peak. Off-peak incentive: RM3,000/month. Fuel savings (no congestion): RM1,500/month. Bonus: can fit 3rd off-peak trip when demand high. Monthly profit up RM6,000. 0% down preserved RM84,000 used for OBU installation, driver night shift training. Off-peak transformation was best business decision.\"</p>
      <p><em>— Zainal Abidin, Operations Director</em></p>

      <h3>Cross-Border Off-Peak Specialist</h3>

      <p>\"Singapore-Thailand route. Border crossings unpredictable—sometimes 1 hour, sometimes 6 hours. Peak hour border waits wasted 3+ hours. Shifted operations to off-peak: 10pm-2am border crossings. Reduced wait times to 1 hour average. Saved 2 hours per trip = 2 additional trips possible daily. Off-peak incentive: RM2,250/day (5 prime movers × 3 trips × RM15). Revenue increase: RM15,000/day (additional trips). Financed 5 prime movers with Ing Heng (0% down), included OBUs. Higher monthly installment but profit increase RM40,000/month. Off-peak strategy transformed margin.\"</p>
      <p><em>— Steven Boon, Managing Director</em></p>

      <h2>Planning Your Off-Peak Transition</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Calculate Current Trip Profitability</h3>

      <p>For each prime mover:
      <br>• Trips per day
      <br>• Revenue per trip
      <br>• Fuel cost per trip
      <br>• Driver cost per trip
      <br>• Current net profit per trip</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Project Off-Peak Profitability</h3>

      <p>With off-peak incentive:
      <br>• Same revenue per trip
      <br>• Reduced fuel cost (no congestion)
      <br>• RM15 incentive per trip
      <br><strong>Compare:</strong> Off-peak profit vs peak profit</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Assess Operational Feasibility</h3>

      <p>Evaluate:
      <br>• Client acceptance of off-peak deliveries
      <br>• Port/warehouse off-peak access
      <br>• Driver willingness for night shifts
      <br>• Dispatcher availability</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Finance Off-Peak Setup</h3>

      <p>Work with financier to:
      <br>• Finance prime movers dedicated to off-peak
      <br>• Include OBU equipment in financing
      <br>• Structure payments based on off-peak revenue (incentive included)</p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line: Off-Peak = Bonus Profit</h2>

      <p>The RM15/trip off-peak incentive isn't just a bonus—it's a profitability multiplier:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Incentive:</strong> RM15/trip pure profit
        <li><strong>Fuel Savings:</strong> RM500-RM1,000 monthly (no congestion)
        <li><strong>Time Savings:</strong> Opportunity for additional trips
        <li><strong>Driver Retention:</strong> Less stress = lower turnover</li>
      </ul>

      <p>0% down payment financing accelerates off-peak transition. OBU equipment included in financing. Incentive earnings exceed transition costs within 60 days.</p>

      <p>Don't leave RM15/trip on the table. Structure your prime mover financing to maximize off-peak profitability.</p>
