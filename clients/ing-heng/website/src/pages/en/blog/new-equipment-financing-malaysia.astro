    <section class="intro">
      <p>Buying new equipment is exciting — until you see the price tag. A new excavator costs RM400,000+. A forklift? RM80,000-RM150,000. For most Malaysian SMEs, paying cash upfront isn't realistic (and even if you can, it's not always smart).</p>
      
      <p>That's where new equipment financing comes in. Instead of draining your working capital, you spread the cost over 3-7 years while using the equipment to make money today.</p>
      
      <p>Here's exactly how it works and what you need to qualify.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-content">
      <h2>What Is New Equipment Financing?</h2>
      
      <p>New equipment financing is a loan specifically for buying brand-new machinery, vehicles, or equipment. The lender pays the supplier directly, and you repay in monthly instalments.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How it's different from a regular business loan:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower rates</strong> — Because the equipment is collateral, rates are typically 1-2% lower than unsecured loans</li>
        <li><strong>Longer terms</strong> — Up to 7 years for heavy equipment (vs 3-5 years for most business loans)</li>
        <li><strong>Easier approval</strong> — The equipment itself backs the loan, so credit requirements are often more flexible</li>
        <li><strong>Tax benefits</strong> — You can claim capital allowances on the equipment, reducing your taxable income</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Finance New Equipment Instead of Used?</h2>
      
      <p>We get this question a lot. Here's the honest comparison:</p>
      
      <div class="comparison-table">
        <h3>New Equipment vs Used Equipment Financing</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Factor</th>
              <th>New Equipment</th>
              <th>Used Equipment</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Interest Rate</strong></td>
              <td>3.5-5% per year</td>
              <td>5-8% per year</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Loan Amount</strong></td>
              <td>Up to 100% of price</td>
              <td>Up to 80% of value</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Repayment Term</strong></td>
              <td>5-7 years</td>
              <td>3-5 years</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></td>
              <td>Full manufacturer warranty (1-3 years)</td>
              <td>Limited or no warranty</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Maintenance Costs</strong></td>
              <td>Low (first 3-5 years)</td>
              <td>Higher (immediate repairs likely)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Approval Speed</strong></td>
              <td>Faster (clear valuation)</td>
              <td>Slower (valuation needed)</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> New equipment costs more upfront, but you get better rates, longer terms, and peace of mind. For businesses relying on equipment daily (construction, logistics, manufacturing), downtime from breakdowns costs more than the premium for new.</p>

      <h2>How Much Does New Equipment Financing Cost?</h2>
      
      <p>Let's break down a real example. Say you're buying a new excavator for RM400,000:</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example: RM400,000 New Excavator</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Equipment Price:</strong> RM400,000</li>
          <li><strong>Down Payment (10%):</strong> RM40,000</li>
          <li><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> RM360,000</li>
          <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> 4.2% per year</li>
          <li><strong>Repayment Term:</strong> 7 years</li>
          <li><strong>Monthly Payment:</strong> RM4,950</li>
          <li><strong>Total Interest:</strong> RM56,040 over 7 years</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>The math that matters:</strong> If that excavator earns you RM15,000-RM20,000 per month on projects, the RM4,950 monthly payment is very manageable. You're cash-flow positive from month one.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>New Equipment Financing Requirements</h2>
      
      <p>What do you need to qualify? Here's what we look at:</p>

        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Don't have perfect credit?</strong> We work with many lenders — some are more flexible if you have a strong business track record, loyal customers, or existing contracts. Let's find a solution that works for you.</p>

      <h2>The New Equipment Financing Process (Step-by-Step)</h2>
      
      <p>Here's exactly what happens when you apply:</p>
      
      <div class="process-steps">
        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 1: Get Equipment Quotation (Day 0)</h3>
          <p>Contact the equipment supplier/dealer and get an official quotation. Make sure it includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Full equipment specifications</li>
            <li>Total price (including any accessories)</li>
            <li>Delivery timeline</li>
            <li>Warranty details</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 2: Submit Financing Application (Day 1)</h3>
          <p>Send us the quotation plus your documents. We'll review and recommend the best financing structure for your situation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 3: Lender Assessment (Day 2-3)</h3>
          <p>The lender reviews your application, checks credit, and assesses your business's ability to repay. Most decisions come within 48 hours.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 4: Approval & Documentation (Day 4-5)</h3>
          <p>Once approved, you'll sign the loan agreement. The terms will be locked in — rate, term, monthly payment, all clear.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 5: Disbursement (Day 6-7)</h3>
          <p>The lender pays the supplier directly. The equipment gets delivered to your site.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 6: Start Using & Repaying (Day 8+)</h3>
          <p>Equipment is yours to use. Monthly repayments start the following month.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Most of our clients go from quotation to equipment delivery in 7-14 days.</p>

      <h2>Tax Benefits: Capital Allowance Explained</h2>
      <p>Here's a bonus: New equipment financing comes with tax advantages.</p>
      
      <p>Under Malaysian tax law, you can claim <strong>capital allowances</strong> on business equipment. This reduces your taxable income, which means lower tax bills.</p>
      
      <div class="tax-example">
        <h3>How Capital Allowance Works:</h3>
        <p>Let's say you buy a new lorry for RM200,000. Here's how capital allowance saves you money:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Initial Allowance (Year 1):</strong> 20% = RM40,000 deduction</li>
          <li><strong>Annual Allowance (Years 1-5):</strong> 20% per year = RM40,000/year deduction</li>
          <li><strong>Total deductions:</strong> RM40,000 (initial) + RM200,000 (annual over 5 years) = RM240,000</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If your company pays 24% corporate tax, that RM240,000 in deductions saves you approximately <strong>RM57,600 in taxes</strong> over 5 years.</p>
        
        <p><em>(Note: Capital allowance rates vary by equipment type. Check with your accountant or LHDN guidelines for specifics.)</em></p>
      </div>

      <h2>Common Questions About New Equipment Financing</h2>
      
      <div class="faq">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I finance 100% of the equipment cost?</h3>
          <p>Some lenders offer 100% financing for established businesses with strong credit. Most require 10-20% down payment. The down payment reduces your monthly payment and often gets you better rates.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What if my business is less than 2 years old?</h3>
          <p>It's tougher, but not impossible. If you have strong sales, existing contracts, or personal assets to put up as additional collateral, we can work with that. Some lenders are more flexible for high-growth startups.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I trade in my old equipment as down payment?</h3>
          <p>Yes! If you're upgrading, many suppliers accept trade-ins. The trade-in value counts toward your down payment, reducing the loan amount needed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What happens if I want to sell the equipment before the loan is paid off?</h3>
          <p>You can sell it, but you'll need to settle the remaining loan balance first (from the sale proceeds). If you're upgrading, some lenders offer refinancing options.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is there a penalty for early repayment?</h3>
          <p>Depends on the lender. Some charge a small penalty (1-3% of outstanding balance), others don't. We always clarify this before you sign.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How does new equipment financing compare to leasing?</h3>
          <p>Financing means you OWN the equipment from day one (with the lender holding a charge until paid off). Leasing means you rent it long-term. Financing is usually better if you plan to use the equipment for 5+ years. Leasing can make sense for equipment that gets outdated quickly (tech, software-based systems).</p>
        </div>
