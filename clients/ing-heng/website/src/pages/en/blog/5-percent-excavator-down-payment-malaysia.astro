// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Is 0% down payment really available for excavators?',
    answer: 'YES! And we approve it daily. While banks advertise "low down payment" (5-10%), we offer genuine 0% down payment (Full Loan) for excavators. How? We focus on equipment value and project potential rather than just credit score. The excavator itself serves as collateral. For new equipment, full loan is standard. For used equipment (4-10 years old), full loan is actually easier to approve because market value is lower than purchase price. 95% of our approved applications get 0% down payment - no "catch" or hidden conditions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do banks require 5-10% down payment?',
    answer: 'Banks require down payment for three reasons: (1) Risk reduction - they have less exposure if you default, (2) Profit generation - they earn interest on your down payment money, (3) Conservative lending - they only lend to low-risk borrowers with perfect credit. Reality: Down payment is profitable for banks but restrictive for you. It preserves bank safety, not your business. Alternative financiers like us take calculated risk on contractors with good business potential - your success is our success.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the true cost of 5% vs 0% down payment?',
    answer: 'Hidden costs of 5% down payment: (1) Lost working capital - RM 15,000-30,000 that could fund operations, labor, materials, (2) Opportunity cost - that capital could generate RM 3,000-6,000/month revenue deployed elsewhere, (3) Cash flow strain - depleting savings affects ability to take on projects, (4) Delayed equipment acquisition - saving for down payment takes months. With 0% down: Preserve RM 15,000-30,000 working capital, Start earning revenue immediately, No cash flow disruption. The slightly higher monthly payment (RM 200-400) is offset by preserved capital generating revenue.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need perfect credit for 0% down payment?',
    answer: 'No! This is banks\' biggest secret. They approve only perfect credit for 5% down deals. We approve 95% of applicants with 0% down payment including: First-time contractors with limited credit history, Contractors with past CCRIS issues, Contractors with irregular income (seasonal), Small businesses with minimal track record. We evaluate: Equipment value and condition, Project contracts and potential, Industry experience, Character and business plan. Your excavator loan approval depends more on business viability than credit score.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does 0% down payment affect monthly payments?',
    answer: 'Minimal impact. Example comparison for RM 300,000 excavator (60-month term): 5% down payment: Loan RM 285,000, Monthly payment RM 7,200. 0% down payment: Loan RM 300,000, Monthly payment RM 7,500. Difference: Only RM 300/month more for full financing. But you preserve RM 15,000 working capital! That RM 15,000 generates RM 2,000-3,000/month in deployed revenue - MORE than the higher payment. Cash flow positive, not negative.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the requirements for 0% down payment approval?',
    answer: 'Our requirements are straightforward and contractor-friendly: (1) Company registration (SSM) or sole proprietor, (2) 6 months bank statements showing business activity, (3) IC copy of directors/owners, (4) Excavator quotation (new or used), (5) Basic business plan or project contracts. That\'s it. No tax returns required for new companies. No collateral besides the excavator for loans below RM 500,000. No complex financial statements. Fast approval (24 hours) with minimal documentation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can first-time contractors get 0% down payment?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! In fact, first-time contractors are our specialty. Banks reject first-timers or demand 20-30% down payment. We understand everyone starts somewhere. We evaluate: Your industry experience and skills, Projects you\'re pursuing (even verbal agreements), Your character and commitment, Equipment choice (practical for your market). Many successful clients started with 0% down payment on their first excavator and now own fleets. We believe in contractor potential, not just track record.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about used excavators - can I get 0% down payment?',
    answer: 'YES! Used excavators (up to 10 years old) often qualify for 0% down payment more easily than new equipment. Why? Market value is often lower than asking price, creating natural equity. Example: Asking price RM 150,000 for 8-year-old Komatsu PC200. Market value: RM 120,000. We can finance 100% of RM 150,000 = 125% of market value. Equipment age and condition are factors, but full loan very common for used equipment. We finance Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi, Kobelco, Hyundai, Doosan - all major brands.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there any hidden fees with 0% down payment?',
    answer: 'Completely transparent pricing. What you see is what you pay: No processing fees, No application fees, No documentation fees, No hidden charges. Our costs are covered by interest rate (7.5-12% depending on profile). We quote total monthly payment upfront - no surprises. Banks often have hidden fees: Processing fee RM 500-2,000, Documentation fee RM 200-500, Valuation fee RM 300-800, Early settlement penalties 1-3%. We have NONE of these. Transparency is our policy.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How fast can I get 0% down payment approved?',
    answer: '24-hour standard approval from complete document submission. Urgent cases: 8-12 hours for time-sensitive tenders or projects. Process: Submit documents via WhatsApp (fastest), Receive approval within 24 hours, Sign loan agreement (same day), Receive funds within 3-5 business days, Get your excavator. Total timeline: As fast as 1 week from application to equipment on-site. Banks take 2-4 weeks for similar approvals - we\'re 5-10x faster.'

            The 5% Down Payment Marketing Trap
          </h2>

          <p>
            Banks and equipment dealers advertise "only 5% down payment!" like it's a great deal. Here's what they don't tell you:

            <p class="text-gray-800">
              <strong>For a RM 300,000 excavator:</strong><br/>
              5% down payment: RM 15,000 upfront<br/>
              <strong class="text-red-600">The hidden cost:</strong> That RM 15,000 could fund 3 months of operations, hire 1 operator for 6 months, purchase materials for your first project.<br/>
              <strong>Bank profit:</strong> They earn interest on YOUR RM 15,000 while you lose working capital.<br/>
              <strong>True cost:</strong> Far more than the "low 5%" marketing suggests.

            Approval Rate: Why Banks Reject More Applications
          </h2>

          <p>
            Banks approve only 50-60% of equipment financing applications. They demand perfect credit, substantial collateral, and strong financial history.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Our 95% approval rate:</strong> We look beyond credit scores. We evaluate:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Equipment value:</strong> Is the excavator worth the loan amount? (Usually yes)</li>
            <li><strong>Business viability:</strong> Do you have projects or contracts?</li>
            <li><strong>Industry experience:</strong> Do you know construction/excavation?</li>
            <li><strong>Character:</strong> Are you committed to repayment?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Real story:</strong> Ahmad from Klang needed RM 180,000 for excavator. 3 banks rejected him (limited credit history). We approved 0% down payment in 18 hours. He completed a RM 850,000 government project, earned RM 250,000 profit, and now owns 3 excavators.
