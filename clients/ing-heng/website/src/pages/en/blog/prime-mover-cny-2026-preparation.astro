      <h2>CNY 2026 Transport Surge: Are You Ready?</h2>

      <p>Chinese New Year 2026 brings the biggest transport surge of the year. Factories rush shipments before shutdown. Retailers stock up for holiday sales. E-commerce delivers gifts nationwide. Your prime mover fleet needs maximum capacity.</p>

      <p>But here's the problem: Prime movers cost RM250,000-RM450,000 each. Banks require 10-20% down payment (RM25,000-RM90,000 per truck). Limited financing for trucks older than 5 years. Long approval processes mean missed opportunities.</p>

      <p>This guide shows you how to prepare your prime mover fleet for CNY 2026 with 0% down payment, finance used trucks, and get approved in 24-48 hours.</p>

      <h2>CNY 2026 Transport Demand Forecast</h2>

      <h3>Peak Period: January 20 - February 15, 2026</h3>

      <p><strong>Volume Increases:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Container haulage: +40-60% vs normal months</li>
        <li>Factory shipments: +80% before CNY shutdown</li>
        <li>Retail distribution: +50% for holiday stock</li>
        <li>E-commerce deliveries: +100% during last 2 weeks</li>
        <li>Port haulage: +70% at Klang, Penang, Johor</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Rates Surge:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prime mover rates: +30-50% premium</li>
        <li>Urgent deliveries: 2x normal rates</li>
        <li>Night/weekend surcharge: RM100-RM200 per trip</li>
        <li>Port congestion surcharge: RM500-RM1,000 per container</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2026 CNY-Specific Factors</h3>

      <p><strong>Early CNY (February 17, 2026):</strong>
      <br>• Peak shipping starts earlier (mid-January)
      <br>• Shorter preparation window than late CNY years
      <br>• Front-loaded demand in January</p>

      <p><strong>Economic Recovery:</strong>
      <br>• Manufacturing rebound increases container volume
      <br>• Export growth drives port activity
      <br>• Consumer spending fuels retail distribution</p>

      <h2>Prime Mover Preparation Checklist</h2>

      <h3>1. Fleet Capacity Assessment</h3>

      <p><strong>Current Capacity:</strong>
      <br>• How many prime movers do you operate?
      <br>• Average utilization rate (normally 60-70%)
      <br>• Planned maintenance during CNY period
      <br>• Driver availability (some take early leave)</p>

      <p><strong>CNY Requirement:</strong>
      <br>• Target utilization: 90-95% during peak
      <br>• Backup trucks: 10-15% of fleet for breakdowns
      <br>• Additional trucks needed: Calculate gap</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong>
      <br>• Current fleet: 10 prime movers
      <br>• Normal capacity: 70 trips/day
      <br>• CNY demand: 120 trips/day
      <br>• Additional needed: 7-8 prime movers</p>

      <h3>2. Maintenance & Inspection</h3>

      <p><strong>Service All Trucks:</strong>
      <br>• Engine oil and filters
      <br>• Transmission fluid
      <br>• Brake system inspection
      <br>• Tire condition (minimum 50% tread)
      <br>• Lights and electrical
      <br>• Air brake system
      <br>• Cooling system</p>

      <p><strong>Timeline:</strong>
      <br>• Start: December 2025
      <br>• Complete: January 10, 2026
      <br>• Buffer: 10 days before peak starts</p>

      <h3>3. Driver Planning</h3>

      <p><strong>Driver Availability:</strong>
      <br>• Confirm holiday leave schedule
      <br>• Recruit temporary drivers if needed
      <br>• Train backup drivers
      <br>• Plan rest schedules (CNY = long hours)</p>

      <p><strong>Incentives:</strong>
      <br>• Overtime pay: 1.5-2x normal rate
      <br>• Trip bonuses during peak
      <br>• CNY ang pow for drivers working holidays</p>

      <h3>4. Documentation & Compliance</h3>

      <p><strong>Ensure Current:</strong>
      <br>• Road tax (valid through February 2026)
      <br>• Insurance coverage
      <br>• JPJ permits
      <br>• APAD permits
      <br>• PUSPAKOM inspection</p>

      <p><strong>Expiring Soon?</strong>
      <br>• Renew in December 2025
      <br>• Avoid last-minute rushes
      <br>• Non-compliance = downtime during peak</p>

      <h2>Real CNY Success Stories</h2>

      <h3>Klang Transport Company - CNY 2025</h3>

      <p>"Applied December 2024 for 3 used prime movers. 0% down payment meant we kept RM75,000 cash for operations. Approved in 48 hours. Trucks deployed by January 10, 2025. CNY month revenue: RM480,000 from 3 trucks (vs RM280,000 normal). Net profit after financing: RM180,000 in one month. Paid 2 trucks fully with CNY earnings. 0% down made it possible—couldn't have afforded RM75,000 down payment during slow December."</p>
      <p><em>— Ahmad Hassan, Fleet Manager</em></p>

      <h3>Johor Port Haulage - CNY 2024</h3>

      <p>"CNY caught us early in 2024. Only 5 prime movers, demand for 10. Bank said 4 weeks approval—too late. Ing Heng approved in 24 hours, added 3 used prime movers (10-year-old models bank rejected). 0% down payment. Deployed in 10 days. Caught CNY peak at Johor Port. RM420,000 revenue from 3 trucks in February 2024. Without fast approval and no age limit, would have missed RM250,000 in peak revenue."</p>
