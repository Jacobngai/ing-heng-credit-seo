    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Running a logistics business in Malaysia is tough. Diesel prices fluctuate, drivers are hard to find, and your biggest asset—the prime mover—costs more than a luxury condo.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      If you're thinking of paying cash for a new Scania, Volvo, or even a used Hino, stop right there. Cash is the lifeblood of your business. You need it for fuel, maintenance, and unexpected repairs. Tying it up in a depreciating asset is risky.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      That's where prime mover financing comes in. But let's be honest: dealing with banks can be a headache. They ask for piles of documents, take weeks to decide, and often reject applications because your company is "too new" or your credit isn't perfect.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      We understand Malaysian businesses because we've been helping them grow for decades. In this guide, we'll break down exactly how prime mover financing works, what your options are, and how to get approved fast—even if the banks said no.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why You Shouldn't Pay Cash for a Prime Mover</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      It might feel good to own a truck outright, but let's look at the numbers. A decent used prime mover can cost RM150,000. A new European model can easily top RM400,000.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      If you pay RM300,000 cash for a truck:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li>You lose that liquidity immediately.</li>
      <li>You can't use that money for emergencies or expansion.</li>
      <li>You miss out on tax benefits (capital allowances).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Instead, if you put down a 20% deposit (say, RM60,000) and finance the rest, you keep RM240,000 in your bank account. That's enough to cover fuel for months, hire more drivers, or handle a slow season without panic.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Types of Prime Mover Financing in Malaysia</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Most people think of "loans," but in commercial vehicle financing, you mainly have two options: <strong>Hire Purchase</strong> and <strong>Leasing</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1. Hire Purchase (Sewa Beli)</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This is the most common option in Malaysia. You pay a deposit, and the bank or credit company pays the rest. You make monthly installments. Once you pay the final installment, the truck belongs to you.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> You own the asset at the end. You can claim Capital Allowances to reduce your tax bill.</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires a down payment (usually 10-20%).</li>
      <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Companies that want to build their asset base long-term.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2. Industrial Hire Purchase (Credit Company)</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This works like standard hire purchase but is offered by licensed credit companies like Ing Heng Credit, not commercial banks.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Much faster approval (often 48 hours). More flexible with documentation. Willing to finance older trucks (10+ years) that banks reject.</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Rates might be slightly higher than bank "prime" rates, but the speed and approval chances are worth it.</li>
      <li><strong>Best for:</strong> SMEs, new companies, or businesses with complex income proof.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Can You Get a 100% Loan?</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      We get asked this a lot. "Can I get 0% down payment?"
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      In the current market, 100% financing for commercial vehicles is very rare unless you have extremely strong collateral or a long track record with the lender. Most lenders will ask for a 10% to 30% deposit.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      However, at Ing Heng Credit, we look at your whole business picture. If you have existing assets or strong contracts, we can sometimes structure a deal with minimal upfront cash. We understand that cash flow is king.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Financing New vs. Used Prime Movers</h2>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">New Prime Movers (Scania, Volvo, Mercedes, MAN)</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Banks love financing new trucks. They are easy to value and have warranties. Interest rates are usually lower.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      <strong>The Catch:</strong> The price tag is massive. And the depreciation in the first 3 years is steep.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Used / Reconditioned Prime Movers</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This is where many Malaysian SMEs start. A 5-year-old Scania is still a workhorse but costs half the price.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>The Problem:</strong> Many banks refuse to finance trucks older than 10 years. They see them as high risk.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      <strong>The Solution:</strong> This is our specialty. We understand that a well-maintained truck can run for 20 years. We finance older vehicles that banks turn away, helping you get affordable fleet expansion.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Documents You Need for Fast Approval</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Want to speed up the process? Have these ready before you apply:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>SSM Documents:</strong> Copies of your business registration.</li>
      <li><strong>Bank Statements:</strong> Usually the last 6 months to show cash flow.</li>
      <li><strong>Directors' IC:</strong> Copy of MyKad for all directors/partners.</li>
      <li><strong>Invoice/Quotation:</strong> The proforma invoice from the seller (dealer or direct seller).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If your bank statements don't look great (maybe you deal in cash or have seasonal income), talk to us. We listen to the story behind the numbers. Banks often just look at the bottom line and say "reject." We look at your contracts, your experience, and your potential.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How to Calculate Your Monthly Repayment</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Before you sign anything, you need to know if you can afford the monthly installment.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Simple Formula:</strong><br/>
      (Loan Amount + (Loan Amount × Interest Rate × Years)) ÷ (Years × 12)
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Don't forget to factor in insurance, road tax, and maintenance. A cheap truck with high maintenance costs can be more expensive than a newer truck with a higher monthly payment.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Choose Ing Heng Credit?</h2>
