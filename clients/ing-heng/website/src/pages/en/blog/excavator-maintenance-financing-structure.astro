// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How does financing structure affect my ability to afford excavator maintenance?',
    answer: 'Critical relationship between loan payments and maintenance capacity: Traditional bank loans (high down payment + high monthly) drain cash flow needed for maintenance, causing deferred maintenance -> more breakdowns -> higher long-term costs. Our financing approach: 0% down payment preserves capital for maintenance fund, Flexible seasonal payments align with revenue (reduce during monsoon), Longer terms (up to 60 months) lower monthly obligation. Result: Adequate cash flow for proper maintenance, reducing total cost of ownership by 30-40% over equipment life.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the true annual maintenance cost for an excavator?',
    answer: 'Comprehensive breakdown for 10-ton excavator (2,000 hours/year): Preventive maintenance: RM 8,000-15,000 (oil, filters, inspections every 250-500 hours), Major repairs: RM 12,000-25,000 (undercarriage at 5,000-8,000 hours, hydraulics), Replacement parts: RM 5,000-12,000 (bucket teeth, wear parts), Labor: RM 3,000-8,000 (mechanic time), Downtime cost: RM 20,000-50,000 (lost rental income). Total: RM 48,000-110,000 annually. Proper preventive maintenance reduces major repair costs by 60-70%.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I build a maintenance reserve into my financing?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! Two effective strategies: (1) Add 10-15% to loan amount for maintenance reserve - financed at same rate, spread over loan term, ensures funds always available. Example: RM 200,000 loan + RM 20,000 reserve = RM 220,000 total financing. Monthly payment increases by only RM 300-400, but you have RM 20,000 available for repairs over 3-4 years. (2) Separate line of credit for maintenance - access as needed, interest only on used amount. Both approaches prevent deferred maintenance and extend equipment life.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do seasonal payment plans help with maintenance during monsoon?',
    answer: 'Monsoon season (Nov-Feb) reduces project activity but maintenance costs continue. Our seasonal payment structure: Reduce monthly loan payments by 40-50% during monsoon, Compensate with higher payments during peak season (Mar-Oct). Benefits: Preserves cash for maintenance when revenue is low, Ensures continued maintenance during wet months (critical for preventing rust and corrosion), Matches payment capacity to project income. Example: Standard payment RM 6,000/month. Seasonal: Monsoon RM 3,500/month, Peak season RM 7,500/month. Cash flow improvement during slow months: RM 2,500/month available for maintenance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What maintenance mistakes increase total cost of ownership?',
    answer: 'Common expensive mistakes: (1) Skipping preventive maintenance to save short-term - leads to 3-5x higher repair costs, (2) Using cheap aftermarket parts - shorter lifespan, potential damage, (3) Inexperienced operators - cause accelerated wear (hydraulics, undercarriage), (4) Ignoring minor issues - small leaks become major failures, (5) No maintenance scheduling - reactive vs proactive approach. Financial impact: These mistakes increase total ownership cost 40-60% over equipment life. Proper maintenance + smart financing = lowest total cost.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does equipment age affect maintenance costs and financing?',
    answer: 'Maintenance cost curve by equipment age: Years 1-3: RM 40,000-60,000/year (warranty covers some items), Years 4-6: RM 60,000-90,000/year (major components wear), Years 7-10: RM 80,000-130,000/year (significant repairs, rebuilding). Financing strategy: New equipment (0-3 years): Standard terms, used equipment (4-7 years): Include maintenance reserve in financing, older equipment (8-10 years): Higher down payment or shorter term to account for increasing maintenance risk. We finance equipment up to 10 years old - terms structured accordingly.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I include maintenance contracts in my financing?',
    answer: 'Yes! Two approaches: (1) Bundle maintenance contract into equipment loan - finance full package over 36-60 months. Example: Excavator RM 200,000 + 3-year maintenance contract RM 45,000 = RM 245,000 total financing. Monthly payment RM 4,800 vs RM 3,900 without contract. Includes all preventive maintenance, major repairs, parts, labor - predictable costs. (2) Separate financing for maintenance package - shorter term (24-36 months) matches contract duration. Both approaches ensure proper maintenance without cash flow surprises.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate total cost of ownership vs purchase price?',
    answer: 'Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) over 5 years for RM 200,000 excavator: Purchase/financing cost: RM 200,000-280,000 (including interest), Maintenance: RM 250,000-400,000, Fuel: RM 300,000-450,000, Operator: RM 120,000-180,000, Insurance: RM 15,000-25,000. TCO: RM 885,000-1,335,000. Purchase price is only 15-23% of total cost! Financing structure impacts maintenance (20-30% of TCO) significantly more than purchase price. Focus on minimizing total cost, not just purchase price.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I cannot afford major repairs during loan term?',
    answer: 'This is a critical risk - 40% of contractors face this issue. Our solutions: (1) Maintenance reserve built into financing (see above), (2) Refinance option for major repairs - add repair cost to existing loan, extend term minimally, (3) Temporary payment holiday - skip 1-2 payments to fund emergency repairs, added to loan end, (4) Trade-in upgrade - if repair cost > 50% of equipment value, trade in and upgrade. Proactive: Include repair contingency in your financing from day one.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does older equipment financing account for higher maintenance?',
    answer: 'Yes! Our terms adjust for equipment age: 0-3 years: Standard terms (0% down, up to 60 months), 4-6 years: Include maintenance reserve requirement, 7-10 years: Higher down payment (10-20%) or shorter term, must demonstrate maintenance fund access. Why: Older equipment requires significant maintenance (RM 80,000-130,000/year). Financing must account for this or contractor defaults. Used equipment financing not just about machine value - about ensuring adequate maintenance capacity.'

            The Hidden Cost: How Financing Structure Affects Maintenance
          </h2>

          <p>
            Most contractors focus on purchase price and interest rate. But the real impact of financing structure is on your <strong>ability to afford proper maintenance</strong>.
          </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-900 mb-2">The Maintenance-Financing Trap</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-800">
              <strong>Scenario:</strong> Traditional bank loan requires 30% down payment + high monthly payments.<br/>
              <strong>Result:</strong> Limited cash flow for maintenance. Contractor skips preventive maintenance to save short-term.<br/>
              <strong>Outcome:</strong> Major breakdown at 4,000 hours. Repair cost: RM 80,000. Equipment downtime: 3 months. Lost revenue: RM 150,000.<br/>
              <strong class="text-red-600">Total unnecessary cost: RM 230,000</strong> - far more than interest savings on "cheaper" loan.

            Smart Financing = Better Maintenance = Lower Total Cost
          </h2>

          <p>
            Our financing approach preserves cash flow for maintenance, reducing total cost of ownership:

          <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 my-6">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-green-900 mb-2">Our Maintenance-Friendly Financing</h3>
            <ul class="text-gray-800 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>0% down payment:</strong> Keep RM 50,000-100,000 capital for maintenance fund</li>
              <li><strong>Seasonal payments:</strong> Reduce payments during monsoon when maintenance continues but revenue drops</li>
              <li><strong>Longer terms:</strong> 60 months = lower monthly obligation = more cash for maintenance</li>
              <li><strong>Maintenance reserve option:</strong> Add 10-15% to loan for dedicated maintenance fund</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>Impact:</strong> Contractors with our financing structure spend 25-30% more on preventive maintenance, experience 60-70% fewer major breakdowns, and extend equipment life by 2-3 years.

            Equipment Age & Maintenance: Financing Adjustments
          </h2>

          <p>
            As equipment ages, maintenance costs increase significantly. Our financing terms adjust accordingly:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Years 0-3 (New/Low Hours):</strong> Maintenance RM 40,000-60,000/year. Standard financing terms available.</li>
            <li><strong>Years 4-6 (Mid-Life):</strong> Maintenance RM 60,000-90,000/year. We recommend maintenance reserve in financing.</li>
            <li><strong>Years 7-10 (Aging Equipment):</strong> Maintenance RM 80,000-130,000/year. Higher down payment or shorter term required, must demonstrate maintenance fund access.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Why we finance older equipment differently:</strong> Not just about machine value - ensuring you have adequate cash flow for the higher maintenance requirements of aging equipment. This protects both you and us from unexpected repair costs causing default.
          </p>
