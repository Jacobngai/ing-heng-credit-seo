# New vs Used Equipment - Budget Optimization 2026

## Banks Only Finance New Equipment

Banks prefer financing new equipment and reject machines older than 5 years. This forces contractors to buy expensive new equipment.

For new equipment costing RM 300,000, banks require RM 30,000 to RM 60,000 down payment.

Used equipment options are limited at banks, reducing budget flexibility.

## Ing Heng Finances New or Used Equipment

We provide equipment financing for both new and used equipment with 0% down payment. Get 100% financing on any equipment age.

Choose the best value for your budget without age restrictions.

## Comparison: New vs Used with Ing Heng

| Feature | New (Banks) | Used (Banks) | New/Used (Ing Heng) |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Down Payment | 10-20% | Usually rejected | 0% |
| Loan Amount | 90% | Rarely approved | 100% |
| Equipment Age | 0 years | Under 5 years | No limit |
| Price | High | Lower | Your choice |

## Real Example: Budget Optimization

Equipment Needed: 1 Ton Excavator

**Option A: New Equipment**
- Price: RM 200,000
- Bank down payment: RM 20,000 - RM 40,000
- Bank loan: RM 180,000 max
- Ing Heng: RM 0 down, RM 200,000 loan

**Option B: Used Equipment (Best Value)**
- Price: RM 50,000
- Bank: Usually rejected (age)
- Ing Heng: RM 0 down, RM 50,000 loan
- Savings: RM 150,000 vs new

**Smart Choice:** Used equipment with Ing Heng saves RM 150,000 plus RM 20,000-40,000 down payment.

## When to Choose New Equipment

New equipment is better when:
- Long-term use (5+ years)
- Latest technology needed
- Warranty important
- Heavy daily use
- Specialized requirements

**New Equipment Prices We Finance:**
- Excavators: RM 200,000 - 500,000
- Forklifts: RM 40,000 - 100,000
- Lorries: RM 100,000 - 300,000
- Cranes: RM 300,000 - 600,000

## When to Choose Used Equipment

Used equipment is smarter when:
- Budget is limited
- Starting new business
- Project-specific need
- Equipment retains value
- Want faster ROI

**Used Equipment Prices We Finance:**
- Komatsu excavator: From RM 34,000
- CAT excavator: From RM 50,000
- Forklift: From RM 15,000
- Lorry: From RM 40,000
- Prime mover: From RM 60,000

## 2026 Budget Optimization Strategy

Maximize your equipment budget with these strategies:

**Strategy 1: Mixed Fleet**
- Buy new for core equipment
- Buy used for secondary equipment
- 0% down on everything

**Strategy 2: Start Used, Upgrade Later**
- Begin with reliable used equipment
- Build revenue
- Upgrade to new later

**Strategy 3: Age Doesn't Matter**
- Well-maintained used equipment
- Same performance as new
- Fraction of the cost

## Budget Comparison Examples

**Scenario 1: RM 100,000 Budget**

With Banks (new only):
- 0.5 new excavator (need more budget)
- Or 2 small used forklifts (if approved)

With Ing Heng (new or used):
- 2 used excavators (RM 68,000)
- + 2 used forklifts (RM 30,000)
- Total: RM 98,000 (100% financed)

**Scenario 2: RM 300,000 Budget**

With Banks (new only):
- 1 new excavator RM 200,000
- Down payment: RM 20,000 - 40,000
- Remaining budget: RM 60,000 - 80,000

With Ing Heng (new or used):
- 1 new excavator RM 200,000 (0% down)
- + 4 used forklifts RM 60,000 (0% down)
- + 1 used lorry RM 40,000 (0% down)
- Total: RM 300,000 (100% financed)

## Why Age Doesn't Matter

Well-maintained used equipment offers:
- Same performance as new
- Proven reliability
- Much lower cost
- Faster payback period
- Better ROI
