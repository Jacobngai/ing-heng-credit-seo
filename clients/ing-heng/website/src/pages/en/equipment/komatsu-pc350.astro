// FAQs - PC350 quarry business scenario
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'I subcontract excavation work. Should I buy my own PC350?',
    answer: 'When you subcontract excavation, you lose RM 50k-80k monthly to outside contractors. Owning your PC350 means keeping that revenue in-house. You control scheduling, quality, and margins. Used PC350 financing with 0% deposit makes this possible without draining working capital. This is vertical integration for quarry operators.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance used Komatsu PC350 for quarry operations?',
    answer: 'Yes! Quarry-proven PC350 excavators are our specialty. We finance equipment 10+ years old. High operating hours are normal for quarries. We assess machine condition and your business contracts. Even 8-year PC350 with 11,000 hours can be financed if well-maintained and you have solid quarry operations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my PC350 is 8 years old with high operating hours?',
    answer: 'We finance PC350 excavators 10+ years old and 15,000+ hours if working properly. PC350 is rated for 15,000-20,000 hours. An 8-year machine with 11,000 hours has 4,000+ productive hours remaining. We assess: Recent maintenance records, hydraulic system health, undercarriage condition, and your quarry contracts. High hours are normal for production machines.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do banks reject old excavators but you approve them?',
    answer: 'Banks use depreciation schedules. They reject equipment over 5 years old regardless of condition. We assess actual working condition and business viability. A well-maintained 10-year PC350 that digs 400 cubic meters daily is more valuable than a poorly maintained 3-year machine. We understand equipment economics, not just accounting rules.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much revenue am I losing to subcontractors?',
    answer: 'Calculate your current subcontracting costs. Most quarry operators pay RM 50k-80k monthly to excavation contractors. Over one year, that is RM 600k-960k. Owning your PC350 means keeping that margin in-house. Your quarry, your equipment, your profits.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get 0% deposit financing for a used PC350?',
    answer: 'Yes! 0% deposit financing is available for qualified applicants. Finance up to 100% of equipment value. This means you can stop subcontracting excavation work immediately without draining working capital. Requirements: Solid quarry operations, equipment in working condition, business viability assessment. Bad credit considered.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What equipment do you finance besides PC350?',
    answer: 'We finance all heavy excavators for quarry operations: Komatsu PC300/PC350/PC400, CAT 336/349/374, Hitachi ZX350/ZX450, Kobelco SK350/SK480. All brands welcome. Equipment 10+ years old accepted. Focus is on working condition and your business potential, not arbitrary age limits like banks use.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does owning equipment help my quarry business grow?',
    answer: 'Vertical integration. When you subcontract excavation, you lose margins to other contractors. When you own equipment, you keep those margins. You control scheduling, quality, and costs. You can take on larger contracts that require equipment ownership. You build business equity, not just paying for services.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents do I need for PC350 financing?',
    answer: 'Required documents: IC/passport and company registration (SSM), 6 months bank statements, quarry license (if applicable), equipment details (seller quotation, photos, serial number, hour meter), current owner grant (if buying from individual). For Japan imports: customs K1 form, import permit, auction sheet. Processing is fast once documents are complete.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there early repayment penalty if I want to settle the loan?',
    answer: 'Early repayment terms vary by financing agreement. Some packages include early settlement fees, others do not. This is negotiable based on your financing package. Discuss early repayment options during application if this matters to your business planning. Many quarry operators refinance or settle early when business grows.'

          <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-[#4F3E29]">
            <p class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">You own a quarry.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              You don't have a heavy excavator. So you subcontract excavation work.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Every month, an excavation contractor sends you an invoice. RM 52,000. RM 68,000. Sometimes RM 80,000.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              When you see those invoices, does your stomach drop? That's YOUR granite. YOUR quarry. But someone else is taking RM 50k-80k monthly because they own the excavator and you don't.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              You've calculated it: Over one year, you've paid RM 650,000 to excavation contractors.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">
              That money could've bought you TWO used PC350 excavators.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              But you're still paying. Month after month. Building someone else's business with your money.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              When you watch their PC350 loading trucks with YOUR granite - do you feel that weight in your chest knowing every bucket-load is profit leaving your quarry?
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">
              You found a used Komatsu PC350. 8 years old. 11,000 hours. Quarry-proven.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Banks reject it. "Too old. High hours."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              But you know: PC350s run 15,000-20,000 hours. This one has 5,000+ productive hours left.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              More importantly: Every hour it works is revenue YOU keep instead of writing checks to subcontractors.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">
              We approve equipment 10+ years old.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Your quarry. Your excavator. Your margins.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Every cubic meter you excavate yourself is profit that stays in YOUR business.
