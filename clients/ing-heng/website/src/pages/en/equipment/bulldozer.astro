// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Can you finance bulldozer fleets for CIDB G7 contractors?',
    answer: 'Yes! We specialize in fleet financing for CIDB G7 contractors and those upgrading from G6. We finance 5-10 bulldozers simultaneously (RM 5M-15M range). Our packages are designed around government tender requirements, equipment ownership scoring, and CIDB registration documentation. We understand tender capacity limits (G7 = unlimited) and structure financing to maximize your competitive advantage.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance GPS-guided and smart technology bulldozers?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! We actively finance GPS-guided bulldozers (CAT AccuGrade, Komatsu iMC, Volvo Co-Pilot). These systems add RM 150K-300K to equipment cost but deliver 30-40% productivity gains and are essential for mega projects like MRT3 and Penang LRT where precision grading (±10mm accuracy) is required. Technology demonstrates tender competitiveness and can add 10-15 points to technical scoring.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the approval process for fleet financing above RM 5 million?',
    answer: 'Fleet financing (RM 5M-15M) requires: (1) Company financials and CIDB registration, (2) Tender documents or confirmed contract awards, (3) Equipment specifications and dealer quotations, (4) Directors\' guarantees and corporate resolutions. Approval timeline: within days from complete documentation. We coordinate directly with equipment dealers (Tractors Malaysia/CAT, Komatsu distributors) for valuation and inspection.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you structure payments around government project cash flows?',
    answer: 'Yes! We understand government payment terms (30-60 days), retention amounts (5-10%), and defects liability periods. We can structure: (1) Lower payments during mobilization phase (Months 1-3), (2) Standard payments during active construction, (3) Balloon payments upon retention release, (4) Interest-only periods for project gaps. This prevents cash flow mismatches common with fixed monthly obligations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance used bulldozers for government tenders?',
    answer: 'Yes, we finance used bulldozers up to 8 years old for government tender purposes. However, note that government tender scoring often favors newer equipment (equipment age <5 years scores higher). For mega projects (MRT3, ECRL), clients typically choose new or 0-3 year old equipment to maximize tender competitiveness. Used equipment (5-8 years) suitable for smaller projects or backup fleet units.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What bulldozer brands are accepted for government tender financing?',
    answer: 'We finance all major brands: Caterpillar (CAT D6-D11 series - market leader), Komatsu (D31-D475 - strong government contractor preference), Shantui (cost-effective Chinese brand), XCMG, Liebherr (European premium), John Deere, Volvo CE. Government tenders typically specify "equivalent to CAT/Komatsu standard" so both Japanese and Western brands score equally. Chinese brands (Shantui, XCMG) acceptable but may score slightly lower in some tenders.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does equipment ownership affect government tender scoring?',
    answer: 'Equipment ownership is CRITICAL for government tender success. Typical tender evaluation: Technical (40-50%), Financial (30-40%), Compliance (10-20%). Within Technical scoring: Equipment ownership = 20-30 points, Personnel = 15-20 points, Experience = 10-15 points. OWNED equipment scores higher than rental or "intent to purchase." For MRT3/ECRL mega tenders, demonstrated fleet ownership (registration documents, PUSPAKOM inspection) can be the deciding factor between winning and losing RM 500M+ contracts.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you help with CIDB upgrade financing (G6 to G7)?',
    answer: 'Yes! CIDB G7 upgrade requires: (1) RM 750K paid-up capital (we verify), (2) Technical personnel (degree holders, 5+ years experience), (3) Equipment ownership/access demonstration, (4) Progressive project track record. We specialize in "equipment ownership" requirement through strategic fleet financing. Typical G7 equipment package: 3-5 bulldozers + 5-8 excavators + 2-3 graders = RM 8M-12M investment. We structure this to demonstrate equipment access without over-leveraging your company.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the down payment for bulldozer fleet financing?',
    answer: 'Standard down payment: 20-30% for fleet financing (RM 5M+). Example: RM 10M fleet = RM 2M-3M down payment. We can reduce to 15-20% if: (1) Confirmed government contract award, (2) Strong company financials, (3) Additional collateral (property). For CIDB G7 contractors with proven track record, we\'ve approved 15% down payment (RM 1.5M on RM 10M fleet). This preserves capital for tender deposits and performance bonds.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the interest rates for bulldozer financing?',
    answer: 'Interest rates: 6.5-10% annually depending on: (1) Fleet size (larger fleets get better rates), (2) Company financial strength, (3) CIDB grade (G7 = better rates), (4) Down payment amount, (5) Equipment age (new = lower rates). Example: RM 10M fleet, 25% down, CIDB G7, new equipment = ~7.2% rate. This is competitive vs. banks (9-15%) and dealer financing (10-18%). Government-linked financing (SME Bank) available at 4.5-5.5% for qualifying contractors.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you finance bulldozers for specific mega projects (MRT3, ECRL, Pan Borneo)?',
    answer: 'Yes! We structure project-tied financing for confirmed contract awards. If you\'ve won (or are bidding on) MRT3, ECRL, Pan Borneo, or flood mitigation packages, we can: (1) Provide conditional approval before tender submission (equipment ownership demonstration), (2) Final approval upon contract award (LOA/LOI), (3) Disburse funds for equipment procurement within 5-7 days, (4) Structure repayments around project milestones and VO payments. We\'ve financed equipment for 15+ mega project contractors since 2023.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide tax benefit guidance for bulldozer investments?',
    answer: 'Yes! Heavy equipment qualifies for capital allowance (tax deduction): Initial Allowance: 20% in Year 1, Annual Allowance: 14% on reducing balance for subsequent years. Example: RM 10M bulldozer fleet investment - Year 1: RM 2M (initial) + RM 1.12M (annual) = RM 3.12M tax deduction. At 24% corporate tax rate = RM 748K tax savings in Year 1. This effectively reduces your equipment cost by 7.5% in Year 1 alone. We provide tax structuring consultation (work with your accountant) to maximize benefits.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the typical fleet composition for a CIDB G7 civil engineering contractor?',
    answer: 'Typical G7 earthmoving fleet (RM 6M-9M investment): Bulldozers: 3-5 heavy units (D8-D11 class) = RM 1.2M-2M each, Excavators: 5-8 hydraulic (30-50 ton) = RM 800K-1.5M each, Motor Graders: 2-3 units = RM 1M-1.8M each, Compactors: 2-3 vibratory = RM 600K-1M each, Dump Trucks: 2-3 articulated = RM 800K-1.5M each. Total: RM 6M-9M. This fleet demonstrates G7 equipment capability for tender scoring and enables RM 60M-75M annual revenue (mega project execution).'
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly can I get bulldozers for an urgent government tender deadline?',
    answer: 'Expedited process for urgent tenders: Day 1: Submit documents + equipment specs (morning), Day 2: Conditional approval + dealer coordination (within 48 hours), Day 3-5: Equipment inspection and valuation, Day 6-7: Final approval and loan documentation, Day 8-10: Disbursement and equipment delivery. For tender submission deadlines, we provide: (1) Conditional approval letter (for "owned equipment" demonstration), (2) Purchase order evidence, (3) Registration documents (post-delivery). We\'ve helped contractors meet 7-day tender deadlines through expedited processing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can foreigners or foreign-owned companies apply for bulldozer financing?',
    answer: 'Yes, but with requirements: (1) Malaysian company registration (SSM), (2) Valid work permits for directors, (3) Malaysian bank account (6 months statements), (4) Local guarantor or additional collateral may be required, (5) CIDB registration (if applying for government tenders). Foreign contractors often partner with Malaysian Bumiputera companies (30% government tender requirement) which strengthens financing applications. International joint ventures for mega projects (MRT3, ECRL) are common and we finance equipment for these consortiums.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if a government project is delayed or cancelled?',
    answer: 'Government project risks are real. Risk mitigation strategies: (1) Portfolio diversification (don\'t depend on single mega project), (2) Payment restructuring options (if project delayed, we can extend terms or reduce payments temporarily), (3) Equipment redeployment (bulldozers are versatile, can be used on other projects), (4) Refinancing options (if you secure another contract, we can restructure). Note: Government mega projects rarely cancel entirely (MRT3, ECRL historically revived after suspensions). Delays of 3-6 months are more common - we provide payment holiday options for such scenarios.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance bulldozer attachments and ancillary equipment?',
    answer: 'Yes! We finance complete bulldozer packages including: Bulldozer attachments: Straight blades, angle blades, U-blades, rippers (single/multi-shank), winches; Ancillary equipment: Low-boy trailers (for mobilization), GPS systems (Trimble, Topcon), telematics platforms, spare parts inventory, workshop tools. Package financing (bulldozer + attachments + trailer + GPS) typically adds 15-20% to base equipment cost but provides turnkey solution. This is preferred by contractors mobilizing for mega projects who need immediate operational capability.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What areas of Malaysia do you serve for bulldozer financing?',
    answer: 'We serve all Malaysian states and focus on mega project regions: Klang Valley (MRT3, flood mitigation), Penang (LRT Mutiara Line, Second Bridge logistics), Johor (industrial parks, Singapore proximity), Sabah & Sarawak (Pan Borneo Highway, state infrastructure), East Coast (ECRL, flood mitigation). Remote area processing via WhatsApp, email, and video calls. We coordinate with nationwide equipment dealers (Tractors Malaysia/CAT branches, Komatsu distributors) for inspection and delivery to any location including Sabah/Sarawak project sites.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I refinance existing bulldozer loans to get better terms?',
    answer: 'Yes! Refinancing benefits: (1) Lower interest rates (if you now have stronger financials or CIDB G7 upgrade), (2) Extended terms (reduce monthly payments), (3) Access additional capital (top-up for fleet expansion), (4) Consolidate multiple equipment loans into one facility. Many clients refinance after 12-18 months when: (1) Their business has grown (mega contract won), (2) CIDB upgrade achieved (G7 = better rates), (3) They need capital for another tender deposit. We\'ve saved clients 2-4% in interest through strategic refinancing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I choose between new vs used bulldozers for government tenders?',
    answer: 'Decision factors: New Bulldozers (0-2 years): Pros - Maximum tender scoring points, GPS technology available, lower maintenance, full warranty, 20-30% productivity gains; Cons - Higher upfront cost, 20-30% more expensive. Used Bulldozers (3-8 years): Pros - Lower capital requirement, faster approval, suitable for backup fleet; Cons - May score lower in tenders, higher maintenance risk, limited GPS technology. Recommendation: For mega projects (MRT3, ECRL) - choose new with GPS. For smaller tenders or second/third units - used acceptable. Hybrid strategy: 2-3 new flagship bulldozers + 1-2 used backup units.'
