// FAQs
const faqs = [
  { question: 'Is it better to lease or buy a forklift?', answer: 'For year-round warehouse operations, buying with financing is more cost-effective than long-term rental. Our ROI analysis shows break-even typically occurs within 18-24 months. After that, you build equity while renters continue paying forever. Financing preserves working capital while giving you ownership benefits.' },
  { question: 'Can I finance used forklifts?', answer: 'Yes! We finance used forklifts up to 8 years old from reputable brands. Equipment must be in good working condition and pass inspection. Used electric forklifts with lithium-ion batteries are excellent investments - lower upfront cost, proven reliability, and still 70-80% of operational lifespan remaining.' },
  { question: 'What are the tax benefits of forklift financing?', answer: 'Equipment financing offers several tax advantages: (1) Depreciation deductions over equipment lifespan, (2) Interest payments are tax-deductible business expenses, (3) Potential green technology incentives for electric forklifts. Consult your accountant for specific tax treatment based on your business structure. Many clients save 20-30% in effective costs through tax benefits.' },
  { question: 'How much does forklift financing cost in Malaysia?', answer: 'Interest rates range from 6.5% to 11% annually depending on credit profile, equipment age, down payment, and loan term. Total monthly payment includes principal + interest. For example: RM 100,000 forklift at 8% over 48 months = RM 2,441/month. Compare this to rental at RM 3,000-3,500/month for the same equipment.' },
  { question: 'Can I finance electric forklifts with lithium-ion batteries?', answer: 'Absolutely! Electric forklifts are 72% of market share and growing. Lithium-ion batteries cost more upfront but deliver 40% better efficiency than lead-acid and 88% better than diesel. We finance the complete package: forklift + lithium battery + charger. Total cost of ownership analysis shows 5-year savings of RM 80,000+ compared to diesel equivalents.' },
  { question: 'What is the difference between forklift leasing and financing?', answer: 'Financing (hire purchase) means you own the equipment at the end. Leasing means you return it or buy it out. Financing builds equity, offers tax depreciation benefits, and gives you control over equipment maintenance. Leasing offers lower monthly payments but no ownership. For established warehouses with long-term needs, financing is typically more economical.' },
  { question: 'How long is the forklift financing term?', answer: 'Standard terms: 12-60 months. Most warehouse operators choose 36-48 months for optimal balance between monthly payment and total interest cost. Shorter terms for used equipment. Longer terms for new electric forklifts with 10+ year lifespan. Match your payment term to equipment expected useful life.' },
  { question: 'Do you finance forklift fleets for expanding warehouses?', answer: 'Yes! Fleet financing is one of our specialties. Benefits: (1) Volume discounts on interest rates for 2+ units, (2) Single monthly payment for all equipment, (3) Staggered delivery schedules to match warehouse expansion, (4) Mix different forklift types in one financing package. Perfect for e-commerce warehouses scaling operations.' },
  { question: 'What documents do I need for forklift financing?', answer: 'For individuals: IC/Passport, 6 months bank statements, income proof. For companies (most common): SSM registration, company bank statements (6 months), directors\' IC, financial statements (if available). Equipment quote/invoice from supplier. The process is simpler than bank business loans - we focus on equipment value and your operational cash flow, not complex financial analysis.' },
  { question: 'Can I finance forklift attachments and spare parts?', answer: 'Yes! We can include attachments (side shifters, clamps, rotators, extended forks) in the financing package. Spare parts can be financed if purchased with the forklift. Battery upgrades (lead-acid to lithium-ion) can also be financed separately. Total solution approach for complete warehouse equipment needs.' },
