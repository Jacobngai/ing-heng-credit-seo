// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is a container side loader and how does it work?',
    answer: 'A container side loader is a specialized trailer with hydraulic cranes that can lift and position containers from the side. Unlike traditional methods requiring external cranes, side loaders provide self-sufficient container handling capability, making them ideal for depots, construction sites, and locations without crane access.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance container side loaders for my logistics business?',
    answer: 'Yes! We specialize in container handling equipment financing including twin hydraulic side loaders, single arm systems, and self-loading trailers. We understand logistics business needs and provide flexible terms for container depot and freight operations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What side loader configurations can you finance?',
    answer: 'We finance all types including twin hydraulic side loaders, single arm systems, tri-axle self-loading trailers, and heavy-duty container handlers. Both new imported equipment and quality used side loaders are considered for financing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you understand Port Klang logistics operations?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! Our Klang location gives us deep understanding of Port Klang container operations, depot requirements, and logistics industry needs. We structure financing terms that align with container handling revenue patterns and seasonal business cycles.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are typical financing amounts for side loaders?',
    answer: 'Container side loader financing typically ranges from RM 300,000 for single arm units to RM 800,000+ for twin hydraulic systems with advanced features. Complete depot equipment packages can range from RM 500,000 to RM 2,000,000 depending on capacity requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance complete container depot setup?',
    answer: 'Yes! We offer comprehensive depot equipment packages including side loaders + reach stackers + terminal tractors + yard equipment in one financing solution. This approach is often more efficient and cost-effective than individual equipment loans.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance used container handling equipment?',
    answer: 'Yes, quality used side loaders and container equipment from reputable suppliers are considered. Used equipment must be in good working condition with available parts and service support. We evaluate equipment history, maintenance records, and remaining useful life.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about side loader maintenance and training?',
    answer: 'Maintenance contracts and operator training can often be included in side loader financing packages. Proper training ensures optimal productivity and equipment longevity. We work with suppliers who provide comprehensive support for container handling equipment.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can logistics startups finance side loaders?',
    answer: 'Yes, we support new logistics businesses with proper business plans, industry experience, and container handling contracts. Startup financing may require higher down payment (25-30%) and demonstration of market demand through pre-contracts or letters of intent.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does approval take for container equipment?',
    answer: 'Standard approval for established logistics businesses is fast from complete application. For new businesses or complex depot setups, allow 1-2 weeks for thorough evaluation including equipment assessment and business review.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer trade-in programs for container equipment?',
    answer: 'Yes! Trade-in programs help offset the cost of upgrading to newer or larger side loaders. Existing equipment value depends on condition and market demand. This reduces down payment requirements for equipment modernization.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents are needed for logistics equipment financing?',
    answer: 'Required: Company registration, financial statements (2 years), equipment quotations, business operations details, and container handling requirements. For established logistics businesses: customer contracts, throughput records, and depot operational data.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance multiple side loaders for fleet expansion?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! Fleet financing available for logistics businesses scaling operations. Multiple equipment purchases often qualify for volume discounts and better financing terms. Ideal for depot expansion or new facility development.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you finance side loaders for construction use?',
    answer: 'Yes! Construction companies using containers for site offices, storage, and temporary facilities can finance side loaders. These provide flexible container placement capability for construction projects and facility development.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about insurance for side loader equipment?',
    answer: 'Equipment insurance is recommended and can sometimes be included in financing packages. We can connect you with insurance providers experienced in container handling equipment coverage for comprehensive protection.'
