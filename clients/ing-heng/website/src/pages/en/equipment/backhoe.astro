// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How much does it really cost to rent vs own a backhoe?',
    answer: 'RENTAL COSTS (Forever): RM 8,000 per month average rental. Limited to 200 hours/month. Extra hours = penalties. Equipment availability not guaranteed. After 3 years of renting = RM 288,000 spent. You own nothing. OWNERSHIP COSTS (Short-term): Used CASE 580 backhoe purchase + financing costs. After 3-5 years of payments, you own the machine. Unlimited hours. Available whenever you need it. Works for another 10-15 years after paid off. THE REAL QUESTION: Do you want to pay RM 8,000 monthly forever and own nothing? Or own equipment that makes you money for 15-20 years?'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will banks finance a used backhoe for my small contracting business?',
    answer: 'NO - banks typically reject used equipment financing for small contractors. Why banks say no: (1) Equipment over 5-7 years old = "No book value." (2) Small contractor = "Too risky." (3) Limited financial history = "Cannot prove repayment ability." Banks follow rigid rules. We evaluate the FULL picture: (1) Can the backhoe work? Hydraulics functional? Engine runs? (2) Do you have construction experience? (3) Do you have contracts or tender opportunities? (4) Is your current financial situation stable? We approve equipment 10+ years old. We finance small contractors. We understand construction reality - a well-maintained backhoe works for decades, regardless of what accounting books say.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I cannot rent equipment when I need it for a job?',
    answer: 'THIS IS THE RENTAL TRAP: Scenario 1 - EQUIPMENT UNAVAILABLE: You won a foundation contract. Need backhoe next Monday. Rental company says "All booked for 2 weeks." You either: (1) Delay project and pay penalties, or (2) Rent from expensive backup company. Scenario 2 - HOUR LIMITS: Your contract needs 280 hours this month. Rental allows 200 hours max. You pay massive penalty fees. Or rush the job and risk poor quality. Scenario 3 - TENDER SCORING: You bid on government tender. Scoring: Equipment Owned = 20 points. Equipment Rented = 5 points. You lose to competitors who own equipment. OWNERSHIP SOLUTION: Your backhoe. Your schedule. Available 24/7. Unlimited hours. Higher tender scores. Complete control.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know if a used CASE 580 or JCB 3CX backhoe is still reliable?',
    answer: 'PRACTICAL INSPECTION CHECKLIST: (1) HYDRAULICS TEST: Operate boom, dipper, bucket, loader. Movement should be smooth, no jerking, no leaks. (2) ENGINE CHECK: Starts easily? Runs smoothly? No excessive black smoke or strange noises? (3) FRAME INSPECTION: Look for cracks at stress points. Minor cracks are weldable. Major frame damage = walk away. (4) TIRES CONDITION: Good tires = RM 8k-15k for full set. Budget this if worn. (5) MAINTENANCE RECORDS: Owner who kept service records likely maintained machine properly. BEST ADVICE: Bring an experienced backhoe operator. A skilled operator can test the machine for 30 minutes and tell you exactly what works and what needs repair. Pay RM 200-500 for expert inspection. This saves you from buying a problem machine.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I finance a backhoe if I have bad credit or business debt?',
    answer: 'YES - bad credit does NOT mean automatic rejection. We evaluate the complete picture, not just credit score. WHAT WE LOOK AT: (1) CURRENT FINANCIAL STABILITY: Show us 6 months bank statements. Are you working now? Income stable? (2) CONSTRUCTION EXPERIENCE: Have you operated backhoes before? Understanding the work reduces risk. (3) BUSINESS PLAN: Do you have contracts lined up? Tender opportunities? Clear path to revenue? (4) EQUIPMENT VALUE: Is the backhoe in good working condition? Good collateral helps approval. BE HONEST: Explain your credit situation. What happened? What changed? We work with many contractors who had past business failures but rebuilt successfully. Banks only see credit scores. We see potential.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if the backhoe breaks down and I still have loan payments?',
    answer: 'REALITY: Equipment breaks down. This is normal. Smart contractors plan for it. PROTECTION STRATEGIES: (1) COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE: Get equipment insurance (RM 2,500-6,000/year). Some policies include loss-of-income coverage during repairs. (2) EMERGENCY FUND: Save 3-6 months of loan payments. This protects you during breakdown or slow contract periods. (3) REGULAR MAINTENANCE: Prevent breakdowns through proper servicing. Cheaper than emergency repairs. (4) COMMUNICATE WITH US: If breakdown happens and you cannot pay, CALL US IMMEDIATELY. We can work out temporary payment plans. We would rather keep you working than repossess equipment. LOAN PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY: You are responsible for payments even during breakdown. This is why insurance and emergency fund are critical. But we understand contractor reality and will work with you on solutions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I buy a backhoe or separate excavator and wheel loader?',
    answer: 'FOR SMALL CONTRACTORS - BACKHOE WINS: Separate equipment: Used 5-ton excavator (RM 250k) + Wheel loader (RM 200k) = RM 450k total investment. Two machines = double maintenance, double insurance, possibly two operators needed. Backhoe option: Used CASE 580 = RM 180k. ONE machine does both jobs. ONE operator. ONE maintenance schedule. ONE insurance policy. YOU SAVE: RM 270k on purchase + thousands annually on maintenance/insurance/operators. THE TRADE-OFF: Excavator digs deeper (6-8m vs 4-5m backhoe). But most small contractor work - foundation trenches, utility installations, site preparation - only needs 1.5-3m depth. A backhoe handles 90% of your jobs perfectly. BOTTOM LINE: Backhoe = smart choice for small contractors. Lower cost, simpler operation, handles most work you will get.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much should I budget monthly for backhoe maintenance and operating costs?',
    answer: 'REALISTIC MONTHLY OPERATING BUDGET: (1) REGULAR SERVICING: RM 2,000-3,500 per service (every 250-500 hours). Average 3-4 services/year = RM 500-1,200/month. (2) DIESEL FUEL: Depends on usage. Heavy use = RM 2,000-4,000/month. (3) INSURANCE: RM 2,500-6,000/year = RM 210-500/month. (4) ROAD TAX: Minimal for construction equipment. (5) TIRES/WEAR PARTS: Budget RM 500-1,000/month for eventual replacement. (6) EMERGENCY REPAIR FUND: Set aside RM 1,000-2,000/month. TOTAL MONTHLY: RM 4,000-8,000 depending on usage intensity. PLUS LOAN PAYMENT: Your financing payment on top of operating costs. REALITY CHECK: Even with these costs, ownership is still cheaper than RM 8,000/month rental forever. And after loan is paid, you only have operating costs while backhoe keeps working.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will owning a backhoe really help me win more tenders?',
    answer: 'YES - equipment ownership significantly improves tender competitiveness. GOVERNMENT TENDER SCORING: Most tender evaluations include equipment ownership criteria. Example scoring: Equipment Owned = 15-20 points. Equipment Rented = 5-10 points. Equipment Subcontracted = 0-5 points. This difference can win or lose tenders. TENDER REQUIREMENTS: Some government and utility tenders REQUIRE equipment ownership. If you rent or subcontract, you cannot even bid. PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES: (1) You can commit to tight schedules (no rental availability issues). (2) You can start immediately (no waiting for rental). (3) You appear more established (equipment = serious contractor). (4) Lower bid prices (no rental markup in your costs). REAL EXAMPLE: Small contractor bought used JCB 3CX. Previously lost tenders to competitors with owned equipment. After purchase, won first government drainage tender within 2 months. Equipment ownership opened doors.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I claim tax deductions for backhoe financing and maintenance?',
    answer: 'YES - significant tax benefits available (consult your accountant for specific advice): (1) CAPITAL ALLOWANCE: Construction equipment qualifies for capital allowance under Malaysian tax law. Initial Allowance (20% first year) + Annual Allowance (14% per year). (2) LOAN INTEREST: Deductible as business expense every year. (3) OPERATING EXPENSES (Fully Deductible): Diesel fuel, maintenance and repairs, insurance, operator salary, parts and components. (4) FINANCING VS CASH PURCHASE: Financing often provides BETTER tax position because: You preserve working capital, you deduct loan interest annually, and you still claim same capital allowances. ACCOUNTING ADVICE: Set up proper bookkeeping from day 1. Keep ALL receipts. Track every expense. File taxes correctly. Hire accountant who understands construction business. Good tax planning can save RM 15,000-40,000 annually for typical backhoe contractor.'

            <p>You're a small contractor. Foundation work. Site preparation. Utility jobs.</p>

            <p>You rent a backhoe when you need it. RM 8,000 per month.</p>

            <p>But rental comes with limits: 200 hours maximum.</p>

            <p>Your projects need 250-300 hours. You either:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rush the work (quality suffers)</li>
              <li>Pay RM 50 per extra hour (penalties add up fast)</li>
              <li>Turn down bigger jobs (can't commit without guaranteed equipment)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Last month, you got a Saturday emergency call. Burst pipe, need trenching NOW. Weekend premium work: Worth RM 12,000.</p>

            <p>You call the rental company. Closed.</p>

            <p>You turn down RM 12,000. You sit at home. The job goes to a contractor who OWNS his backhoe.</p>

            <p>Does that missed revenue eat at you all weekend?</p>

            <p>When Monday comes and you see that contractor's Facebook post: "Weekend emergency job, saved the day" - and you know YOU could've done it if you owned equipment - does it sting?</p>

            <p>You've rented for 3 years. RM 8,000 monthly. That's RM 288,000.</p>

            <p>You could've OWNED a used backhoe after 18 months of those payments.</p>

            <p>But instead, you're still renting. Still limited. Still missing opportunities.</p>
