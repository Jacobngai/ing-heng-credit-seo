When you’re running a small delivery business in Malaysia, watching other logistics operators load their OWN 3-ton lorries while you’re stuck paying rental fees month after month, does that create a knot in your stomach knowing you’re building someone else’s business instead of your own?

## The Hidden Cost of NOT Owning Your 3-Ton Lorry

Picture this: It’s 7 AM, and you’re outside the rental depot waiting for your assigned 3-ton lorry. The clerk tells you, “Sorry, all trucks are booked today.” Your phone starts buzzing with delivery orders worth RM 1,200, but you have to turn them all down. Does that missed opportunity burn in your chest?

Or imagine writing that RM 3,500 monthly rental check, knowing that after 3 years of payments (RM 126,000 total), you’ll still own nothing. Meanwhile, that same money could have bought you a reliable 3-ton lorry outright.

**This is exactly why small logistics operators across Malaysia are switching from rental to ownership.**

## Why 3-Ton Lorries Are Perfect for Malaysian Small Businesses

### The Sweet Spot for Local Delivery

3-ton lorries hit the perfect balance for Malaysian logistics:

• **Right Size for Urban Areas**: Navigate narrow shop lots in KL, Penang, JB

• **Fuel Efficient**: Lower operating costs than larger trucks

• **Versatile Loading**: Handle everything from furniture to construction materials

• **No CDL Required**: Regular driving license sufficient for most 3-ton models

• **High Demand**: Constant bookings for house moves, shop deliveries, small construction jobs

### Real Revenue Potential

Malaysian 3-ton lorry owners report:

• **House Moving**: RM 400-800 per job (2-3 jobs weekly = RM 3,200-4,800 monthly)

• **Shop Restocking**: RM 200-350 per delivery (daily routes = RM 6,000-10,500 monthly)

• **Construction Materials**: RM 180-280 per load (5-8 loads weekly = RM 3,600-8,960 monthly)

• **Furniture Delivery**: RM 150-400 per delivery (furniture stores love reliable partners)

**Key Insight**: Your own 3-ton lorry means YOU keep 100% of these earnings instead of splitting with truck rental companies.

### Our 3-Ton Lorry Success Stories

**Ahmad’s Furniture Delivery Empire**

Ahmad was paying RM 3,200 monthly to rent a 3-ton Dyna. When the rental company suddenly needed it back during his busiest moving season, he lost RM 8,000 worth of confirmed bookings.

*“That weekend, I decided enough was enough. ING HENG approved me for a 12-year-old Isuzu NPR with zero deposit. Now I control my schedule, keep all my profits, and just expanded to a second truck!”* - Ahmad, Furniture Delivery Contractor

**Siti’s Express Delivery Network**

Siti started with one rented 3-ton lorry for her grocery delivery service. As demand grew, rental costs ate into her margins.

*“The rental company wanted RM 4,000 monthly for a second truck. ING HENG financed two 8-year-old 3-ton lorries for less than what I was paying in rental. My delivery network tripled in 6 months!”* - Siti, Express Delivery Owner
