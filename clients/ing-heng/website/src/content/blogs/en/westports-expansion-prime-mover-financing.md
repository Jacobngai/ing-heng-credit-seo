Westports 2: A Game-Changer for Container Hauliers
          

          


            In September 2024, Westports launched its RM 12.6 billion expansion project that will transform Port Klang's container handling capabilities. The expansion will double capacity from **14 million to 28 million TEUs by 2028**, creating unprecedented opportunities for hauliers.
          



          


            For container hauliers, this expansion means:
          



          

- **Doubled haulage demand** - More containers = more prime movers needed
- **Long-term contracts** - Secure preferred haulier status with shipping lines early
- **Fleet expansion opportunities** - Growing demand requires more equipment
- **Competitive advantage** - First movers get the best contracts
