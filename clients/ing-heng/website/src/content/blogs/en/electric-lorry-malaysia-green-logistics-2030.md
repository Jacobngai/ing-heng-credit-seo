## The Green Logistics Mandate: 2030 is Closer Than You Think



      

Malaysia has committed to reducing carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels). Transport sector emissions must decrease 30-40% to achieve this target.



      

The government's strategy: Accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption in commercial transport.



      

**Policy Target:** 40% of new lorry registrations must be electric by 2030. This isn't a recommendation—it's becoming a requirement for government tenders and large corporations.



      

For logistics companies, this creates both challenge and opportunity. Electric lorries cost more upfront but offer long-term advantages. The question is: how do you finance the transition without straining your business?



      

## Why Electric Lorries Cost More: The Premium Breakdown



      

### Equipment Cost Comparison



      

**Diesel 5-Ton Lorry:** RM180,000 - RM220,000
      
**Electric 5-Ton Lorry:** RM320,000 - RM400,000
      
**Cost Premium:** 70-100% higher



      

### What Drives the Higher Cost?



      

- **Battery Technology:** RM80,000-RM150,000 per battery pack (most expensive component)
- **Electric Motor:** RM30,000-RM50,000 (vs RM20,000 diesel engine)
- **Power Electronics:** RM20,000-RM35,000 (inverter, converter, charging systems)
- **Thermal Management:** RM8,000-RM12,000 (battery cooling systems)
- **Low Production Volume:** economies of scale not yet achieved



      

### Charging Infrastructure Costs



      

Electric lorries require:
      
• Charging station installation: RM30,000-RM80,000
      
• Electrical upgrades: RM20,000-RM50,000 (3-phase power, increased capacity)
      
• Backup power source: RM15,000-RM30,000 (generator or battery storage)



      

**Total Infrastructure Cost:** RM65,000-RM160,000 beyond lorry purchase



      

## The Electric Lorry Advantage: Beyond Emissions



      

### Operating Cost Savings



      

**Energy Cost Comparison:**
      
• Diesel lorry: RM3,000/month fuel (based on RM2.50/liter, 1,200 liters/month)
      
• Electric lorry: RM1,000/month electricity (based on RM0.50/km, 2,000 km/month)
      
**Monthly Savings:** RM2,000 per lorry



      

### Maintenance Cost Reduction



      

**Diesel Lorry Maintenance (Annual):**
      
• Oil changes: RM1,200
      
• Filter replacements: RM800
      
• Engine repairs: RM8,000-RM15,000 (unpredictable)
      
**Total:** RM10,000-RM17,000



      

**Electric Lorry Maintenance (Annual):**
      
• No oil changes
      
• Minimal filter replacements
      
• Battery servicing: RM3,000-RM5,000 (predictable)
      
**Total:** RM3,000-RM5,000



      

**Annual Savings:** RM7,000-RM12,000 per lorry



      

### Performance Advantages



      

**Electric Lorry Benefits:**
      
• Instant torque (better acceleration from stop)
      
• Quiet operation (night deliveries in urban areas)
      
• Zero emissions at point of use (indoor warehouses, ports)
      
• Regenerative braking (extends range, reduces brake wear)



      

## ROI Analysis: Electric vs Diesel Lorry Over 5 Years



      

### Scenario: 100,000 km/Year Operation



      

**Diesel Lorry:**
      
• Purchase cost: RM200,000
      
• Fuel cost: RM36,000/year (RM3,000 × 12)
      
• Maintenance: RM12,000/year average
      
• Resale value after 5 years: RM80,000-RM100,000



      

**Electric Lorry:**
      
• Purchase cost: RM360,000
      
• Electricity cost: RM12,000/year (RM1,000 × 12)
      
• Maintenance: RM4,000/year
      
• Resale value after 5 years: RM150,000-RM180,000



      

**5-Year Total Cost of Ownership:**
      
• Diesel: RM200,000 + RM180,000 (fuel) + RM60,000 (maintenance) - RM90,000 (resale) = RM350,000
      
• Electric: RM360,000 + RM60,000 (electricity) + RM20,000 (maintenance) - RM165,000 (resale) = RM275,000
      
**Electric Savings:** RM75,000 over 5 years



      

**Result:** Despite higher purchase price, electric lorry costs RM75,000 less to operate over 5 years.



      

## Financing Electric Lorries: Strategic Considerations



      

### 1. Higher Purchase Price = Higher Financing Need



      

Electric lorries at RM320,000-RM400,000 require larger financing:
      
• 0% down payment preserves RM64,000-RM80,000 per lorry (vs RM40,000-RM48,000 for diesel)
      
• Preserved capital critical for:
      
  - Charging infrastructure installation
      
  - Backup power systems
      
  - Driver training on electric vehicle operation



      

### 2. Include Charging Infrastructure in Financing



      

We finance:
      
• Electric lorry
      
• Charging station installation
      
• Electrical upgrades
      
• Backup power source



      

**Bundled Financing Example:**
      
• Electric lorry: RM360,000
      
• Charging station + electrical work: RM60,000
      
**Total Financed:** RM420,000



      

### 3. Consider Total Cost, Not Just Monthly Payment



      

Electric lorry monthly installment may be higher (due to higher purchase price), but:
      
• Fuel savings offset part of higher installment
      
• Maintenance savings provide additional offset
      
• Overall ROI is often better despite higher nominal cost



      

### 4. Government Incentives and Grants



      

Available programs:
      
• Green Technology Financing Scheme (GTFS) – low-interest loans for EVs
      
• Electric Vehicle Adoption Grant (up to RM5,000 per lorry)
      
• Income tax exemption (EV benefits from income tax)

## Real-World Electric Lorry Success Stories



      

### Port Klang Green Logistics



      

"Won government contract requiring 40% electric fleet by 2026. Initially resisted—electric lorries cost RM360,000 vs RM200,000 diesel. Ing Heng showed ROI analysis: operating savings RM24,000/year per lorry (fuel + maintenance). Higher purchase price recovered in 4-5 years. Financed 5 electric lorries with 0% down payment, plus charging infrastructure. Now 40% of fleet (8 electric lorries out of 20). Operating costs down 15%. Won additional government contract requiring 100% electric fleet. Electric transition was best business decision."


      

*— Zainal Abidin, Green Logistics Director*



      

### Urban Delivery Specialist – Klang Valley



      

"Do last-mile delivery for KL malls and offices. Diesel lorries prohibited from certain zones during daytime due to emission concerns. Needed 3 electric lorries for urban access. Financed with Ing Heng at 0% down. Higher monthly installment than diesel (RM8,000 vs RM5,000), but fuel savings of RM2,000/month + urban access benefits more than offset premium. Now have 8 electric lorries, access to all urban zones. Quiet operation allows night deliveries, expanding capacity by 30%. Electric lorries opened markets diesel couldn't serve."


      

*— R. Kumararaj, Last-Mile Specialist*



      

## Planning Your Electric Fleet Transition



      

### Step 1: Assess Current Routes



      

Evaluate:
      
• Daily distance per lorry (under 300km/day = ideal for electric)
      
• Access to charging infrastructure (depot vs public stations)
      
• Urban routes (emissions restrictions favoring electric)



      

### Step 2: Calculate Charging Strategy



      

Options:
      
• Depot charging: Install chargers at your base (requires electrical upgrades)
      
• Public charging: Rely on growing network (lower infrastructure cost, less control)
      
• Mixed strategy: Depot for overnight, public for top-ups if needed



      

### Step 3: Determine Replacement Schedule



      

Plan:
      
• Replace oldest/most high-mileage lorries first
      
• Phase replacement over 3-5 years (not all at once)
      
• Time replacements with trade-in value maximization



      

### Step 4: Get Pre-Approved Financing



      

Before shopping for electric lorries:
      
• Get pre-approved for EV financing
      
• Allows immediate purchase when right vehicle found
      
• Positions you to take advantage of government incentives



      

## The Bottom Line: Electric is the Future, Financing is the Enabler



      

Malaysia's 2030 emissions targets require transport sector electrification. Government tenders increasingly require electric vehicle capability. Major corporations demand green logistics from their suppliers.



      

The higher upfront cost of electric lorries is justified by:
      
• 70-100% lower operating costs (fuel + maintenance)
      
• Access to restricted urban zones and government contracts
      
• Regulatory compliance (avoiding future diesel restrictions)
      
• Environmental leadership (competitive differentiator)



      

0% down payment financing makes electric lorry acquisition accessible without straining capital. Purchase the lorries, install charging infrastructure, and benefit from operating cost savings that cover financing costs.
