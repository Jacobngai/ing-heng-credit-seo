## The RM15/Trip Incentive: Government Pays You to Drive Off-Peak



      

Malaysia's highways are congested during peak hours. 6am-10am and 4pm-8pm: traffic jams, delays, frustration.



      

The government's solution: incentivize heavy vehicles to drive during off-peak hours.



      

**The Offer:** RM15 per trip for prime movers entering major highways during off-peak hours (10pm-6am).



      

For a prime operator making 300 trips monthly, that's RM4,500 in additional profit—purely for adjusting your schedule.



      

## How the Off-Peak Incentive Works



      

### Program Details



      

**Eligible Vehicles:**
      
• Prime movers (head trucks)
      
• Heavy lorries (5-ton and above)
      
• Trailers and container carriers



      

**Eligible Highways:**
      
• North-South Expressway (PLUS)
      
• AKLEH Highway
      
• KESAS Highway
      
• Other major highways (check latest list with JPJ)



      

**Off-Peak Hours:**
      
• Night: 10:00pm - 6:00am
      
• Incentive rate: RM15 per highway entry



      

### Application Process



      

- Register with JPJ/LLM (Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia)
        Install on-board unit (OBM) tracking device
        Obtain off-peak vehicle sticker
        Submit monthly trip logs
        Receive incentive payment monthly



      

## The Profitability Math: Off-Peak Operations



      

### Revenue Impact Calculation



      

**Current Operations (Peak Hours Only):**
      
• Trips per day: 2
      
• Revenue per trip: RM1,500
      
• Daily revenue: RM3,000
      
• Monthly revenue (25 days): RM75,000
      
**Off-Peak Incentive:** RM0 (not participating)



           

**Off-Peak Operations (Same 2 Trips, Adjusted Schedule):**
      
• Trips per day: 2 (now 10pm-6am)
      
• Revenue per trip: RM1,500 (same rate)
      
• Daily revenue: RM3,000
      
• Monthly revenue (25 days): RM75,000
      
**Off-Peak Incentive:** RM750/day (RM15 × 2 trips × 25 days)
      
**Monthly Bonus:** RM18,750



      

**Annual Bonus:** RM225,000 additional profit



      

### Additional Benefits Beyond RM15/Trip



      

**Fuel Savings:**
      
• No traffic congestion = consistent speed
      
• Peak hours: stop-and-go driving increases fuel consumption 15-20%
      
• Off-peak: steady speed = optimal fuel efficiency
      
**Fuel Savings:** RM500-RM1,000 monthly



      

**Time Savings:**
      
• Peak hours: 2 hours per trip (traffic delays)
      
• Off-peak: 1.5 hours per trip (clear roads)
      
• Time saved: 30 minutes per trip
      
**Result:** Can fit 3 trips in same time (if demand exists) = RM1,500 additional revenue per day



      

**Driver Benefits:**
      
• Less stressful driving (no congestion frustration)
      
• Better sleep schedule (night operations)
      
• Higher driver retention



      

## Financing Off-Peak Operations: What You Need



      

### OBU (On-Board Unit) Installation



      

**Required Equipment:**
      
• GPS tracking device
      
• Highway entry detection sensor
      
• Data transmission unit
      
**Cost:** RM2,000-RM3,500 per prime mover



      

**Financing Solution:**
      
• Include OBU in prime mover financing
      
• RM3,500 spread over 5-year term = RM70/month additional
      
• Off-peak incentive (RM750/month) more than covers OBU cost



      

### Operational Adjustments



      

Off-peak operations require:



      

- **Night Dispatch:** Dispatcher available 10pm-6am
- **Driver Availability:** Drivers willing to work night shifts
- **Client Coordination:** Wareports must accept late-night/early-morning deliveries
- **Port Access:** Ports must allow off-peak container pickup/drop-off



      

### Additional Prime Movers for Peak/Off-Peak Split



      

Optimal strategy: Split fleet between peak and off-peak operations:



      

**Example Fleet (10 Prime Movers):**
      
• 6 prime movers: Peak hours (6am-10am, 4pm-8pm)
      
• 4 prime movers: Off-peak hours (10pm-6am)
      
**Incentive Earnings:** 4 prime movers × 2 trips/day × RM15 × 25 days = RM3,000/month



      

## Ing Heng Credit: Off-Peak Optimization Financing



      

### 1. We Finance Complete Off-Peak Setup



      

We finance:
      
• Prime mover purchase
      
• OBU installation
      
• JPJ registration modifications
      
• Initial off-peak permit fees



      

**Result:** One monthly payment covers all off-peak requirements.



      

### 2. 0% Down Payment Accelerates Off-Peak Transition



      

Transitioning to off-peak operations requires:



      

- OBU equipment purchase: RM3,500 per prime mover
        Driver night shift differential pay: +RM500/month per driver
        Dispatcher night shift: Additional staff cost

• Profitability begins immediately



      

### 3. Flexible Terms for Seasonal Adjustments



      

Off-peak demand varies by season:



      

- Festive periods: High demand (off-peak valuable)
        Monsoon seasons: Reduced demand (may revert to peak operations)
        Economic slowdowns: Port volumes drop (off-peak may be only option)



      

We offer:
      
• Seasonal payment adjustments
      
• Skip payments during low-volume months
      
• Balloon payments during high-volume months



      

### 4. Multiple Prime Mover Financing



      

Optimal off-peak/peak split requires multiple prime movers:



      

**Example: 10 Prime Mover Fleet**
      
• 4 off-peak dedicated: RM1.4 million
      
• 6 peak/off-peak flexible: RM2.1 million
      
**Total Investment:** RM3.5 million



      

We finance entire fleet with 0% down payment, bundle all OBU equipment, and structure payments to match off-peak revenue patterns.



      

## Real-World Off-Peak Success Stories



      

### Port Klang Night Operations



      

\"Operated 6 prime movers on peak hours only. Constant congestion, wasted fuel, driver stress. Heard about RM15 off-peak incentive. Ing Heng financed 2 additional prime movers (0% down) dedicated to off-peak. Installed OBU on all 8 prime movers. Trained drivers for night shifts. Now 4 prime movers run off-peak, 4 remain peak. Off-peak incentive: RM3,000/month. Fuel savings (no congestion): RM1,500/month. Bonus: can fit 3rd off-peak trip when demand high. Monthly profit up RM6,000. 0% down preserved RM84,000 used for OBU installation, driver night shift training. Off-peak transformation was best business decision.\"


      

*— Zainal Abidin, Operations Director*



      

### Cross-Border Off-Peak Specialist



      

\"Singapore-Thailand route. Border crossings unpredictable—sometimes 1 hour, sometimes 6 hours. Peak hour border waits wasted 3+ hours. Shifted operations to off-peak: 10pm-2am border crossings. Reduced wait times to 1 hour average. Saved 2 hours per trip = 2 additional trips possible daily. Off-peak incentive: RM2,250/day (5 prime movers × 3 trips × RM15). Revenue increase: RM15,000/day (additional trips). Financed 5 prime movers with Ing Heng (0% down), included OBUs. Higher monthly installment but profit increase RM40,000/month. Off-peak strategy transformed margin.\"

## Planning Your Off-Peak Transition



      

### Step 1: Calculate Current Trip Profitability



      

For each prime mover:
      
• Trips per day
      
• Revenue per trip
      
• Fuel cost per trip
      
• Driver cost per trip
      
• Current net profit per trip



      

### Step 2: Project Off-Peak Profitability



      

With off-peak incentive:
      
• Same revenue per trip
      
• Reduced fuel cost (no congestion)
      
• RM15 incentive per trip
      
**Compare:** Off-peak profit vs peak profit



      

### Step 3: Assess Operational Feasibility



      

Evaluate:
      
• Client acceptance of off-peak deliveries
      
• Port/warehouse off-peak access
      
• Driver willingness for night shifts
      
• Dispatcher availability



      

### Step 4: Finance Off-Peak Setup



      

Work with financier to:
      
• Finance prime movers dedicated to off-peak
      
• Include OBU equipment in financing
      
• Structure payments based on off-peak revenue (incentive included)
