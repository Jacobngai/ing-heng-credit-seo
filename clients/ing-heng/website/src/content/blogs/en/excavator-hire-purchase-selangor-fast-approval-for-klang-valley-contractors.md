Need an excavator for your Selangor construction project? Hire purchase financing helps you own equipment while spreading the cost over 3-5 years. At Ing Heng Credit, we serve Klang Valley contractors with fast approvals and competitive rates.

**Why contractors choose us:**

• Based in Klang - we understand local construction needs

• Fast approval (faster than banks’ 2-4 week process)

• high approval rate for qualified applicants

• Finance excavators from 1.5 tons to 25 tons

• Competitive rates starting from 2.88% per annum

• Used excavators accepted (up to 10 years old)

Located at **47A, Jalan Raya Timur, Klang**, we’ve served Selangor contractors for 40 years.

## Why Selangor Contractors Choose Hire Purchase

### 1. Own the Excavator from Day One

Unlike rental, hire purchase gives you ownership rights immediately. You can:

• Use the excavator for any project

• Work without daily rental charges

• Build company assets

• Deduct installments as business expenses

### 2. Better Cash Flow Management

Spread the excavator cost over 36-60 months. This helps with:

• **Monsoon season slowdowns** (Nov-Feb)

• **Project payment delays**

• **Maintaining working capital**

• **Seasonal cash flow fluctuations**

### 3. Fast Approval for Urgent Projects

Banks take 2-4 weeks. We provide much faster responses. This matters when:

• You win a tender requiring owned equipment

• A rental excavator breaks down mid-project

• You need to start work immediately

• Your competitor is bidding for the same project

### 4. High Approval Rates

Our high approval rate helps contractors who:

• Have credit scores 580+ (banks require 700+)

• Run cash-based businesses

• Are new companies (1-2 years old)

• Have seasonal income patterns
