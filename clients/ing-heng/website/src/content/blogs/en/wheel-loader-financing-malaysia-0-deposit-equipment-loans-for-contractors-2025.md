When you walk through your quarry every morning and see that rented CAT 966 loading 80 trucks per day, and you know that RM 18,000 rental check you wrote last week could have been a payment toward owning it, does your chest tighten knowing you’re building someone else’s empire instead of your own?

When the rental company calls at 5 PM demanding their wheel loader back for “routine maintenance” right before your biggest loading day of the month, and you have 60 trucks scheduled for tomorrow morning, do you feel that panic grip your throat knowing those truckers will go to your competitor instead?

When you calculate that RM 18,000 monthly rental over 3 years equals RM 648,000—enough to own TWO quality used wheel loaders—does that frustration burn in your stomach like swallowing fire?

**Stop feeding the rental companies. Start feeding your own business.**

## Your Loader. Your Schedule. Your Quarry Profits.

At Ing Heng Credit, we’ve watched too many quarry operators and contractors surrender massive profits to rental companies. That’s why we offer **0% deposit wheel loader financing** with **100% financing options** that put you in the driver’s seat from day one.

No more rental schedules controlling your loading operations.
No more monthly payments vanishing into rental company accounts.
No more missed contracts because equipment isn’t available when you need it.

**Your wheel loader. Your timeline. Your revenue.**

## The Rental Trap That’s Bleeding Your Business

### The Hidden Cost of Never Owning

Ahmad runs a sand quarry in Rawang. For 4 years, he’s been paying RM 16,500 monthly to rent a CAT 966D wheel loader.

**Total rental payments: RM 792,000**

**For that same amount, he could have owned THREE quality wheel loaders.**

But the rental company made it sound convenient: “No maintenance headaches, no breakdown risks, just pay and operate.”

What they didn’t reveal:

• He built zero equity despite paying RM 792,000

• Every ton of sand loaded generated rental company profits

• His quarry couldn’t expand because he owned no assets

• When peak season hit, equipment wasn’t always available

### The Loading Schedule Problem

**Rental companies control your most profitable hours.**

• Peak morning loading (6 AM - 10 AM)? “Sorry, scheduled maintenance.”

• Weekend emergency orders? “Equipment not available after hours.”

• Extended project needs? “Next customer is waiting.”

**When you don’t own the loader, you don’t control your quarry operations.**

Siti lost a RM 45,000 weekend sand order because her rented wheel loader “needed inspection” and the backup was at another site.

**Rental companies profit from YOUR inconvenience.**

### The Asset Limitation Trap

Here’s what rental companies will never tell you: **You can’t build a serious quarry or construction business on rented equipment.**

Banks look at your asset base when considering business loans. Own RM 1.2 million in equipment? You can get RM 3 million in working capital.

Own nothing but pay RM 18,000 monthly in rental? Banks see you as high-risk with zero collateral.

**Equipment ownership = Business expansion power.**

## 0% Deposit: Your Path to Loader Ownership

### What 0% Deposit Really Means for Wheel Loaders

**Zero upfront payment. Finance 100% of the equipment value.**

• CAT 966 costs RM 450,000? Finance RM 450,000.

• Komatsu WA320 costs RM 380,000? Finance the full amount.

• Want to preserve cash for quarry expansion? Finance everything.

**This is your competitive advantage over operators still trapped in rental cycles.**

### Why We Offer 0% Deposit When Others Won’t

**Traditional banks require 20-30% deposit because:**

• They don’t understand quarry cash flow patterns

• They fear equipment depreciation on older loaders

• They use rigid lending criteria designed for office businesses

**We offer 0% deposit because:**

• We understand seasonal quarry revenue cycles

• We know quality wheel loaders operate 15,000+ hours reliably

• We assess quarry potential, not just financial statements

**40+ years financing wheel loaders taught us: The equipment pays for itself when the operator owns it.**

### Real Customer Example: Kumar’s Transformation

Kumar needed a used CAT 966D (11 years old) for his aggregate quarry operation.

**Bank Response:** “Rejected. Equipment too old. Need 35% deposit minimum.”

**Our Response:** “Approved. 0% deposit. 100% financing.”

**Results after 30 months:**

• Monthly payment: RM 9,200 (vs RM 16,500 rental)

• Savings: RM 7,300 monthly

• Additional revenue: RM 25,000/month (extended operating hours)

• Business growth: From 800 to 1,400 tons monthly production

**Kumar built equity while competitors built rental company wealth.**

## We Finance Loaders Banks Reject

### 10+ Year Equipment: Our Specialty

**Banks say:** “Sorry, wheel loader must be under 7 years old.”

**We say:** “Show us a well-maintained 15-year-old CAT 966 and we’ll finance it.”

**Why age doesn’t limit us:**

• Quality wheel loaders run 15,000-20,000 hours (12-18 years)

• Proper maintenance matters more than manufacturing year

• Experienced operators know equipment condition better than bank committees

• Some of our most successful clients operate 15-20 year old loaders profitably

### Equipment We’ve Recently Financed

**CAT 966D - 13 years old**

• Bank rejection: “Too old for financing”

• Our approval: 0% deposit, 84 months

• Customer outcome: Still loading 1,200 tons daily after 3 years

**Komatsu WA320 - 16 years old**

• Bank rejection: “Beyond financing parameters”

• Our approval: 15% deposit, 72 months

• Customer outcome: Quarry operator expanded to 3-loader fleet

**Volvo L120E - 14 years old**

• Bank rejection: “High depreciation risk”

• Our approval: 10% deposit, 60 months

• Customer outcome: Equipment paid itself off in 28 months

**The pattern: Banks see age. We see opportunity and condition.**

## Fast Approval When Production Can’t Wait

### Why Speed Matters in Quarry Operations

**Quarry opportunities don’t wait for bank committees.**

• Construction projects need immediate sand supply

• Government infrastructure has tight delivery deadlines

• Equipment breakdowns require immediate replacement

• Peak seasons demand maximum loading capacity

**When you need wheel loader financing fast, banks move slowly:**

• 3-4 weeks approval process

• Multiple committee reviews

• Endless documentation requests

• Conservative decision-making

### Our Rapid Approval Process

**Day 1: Submit Application**

### Customer Success: Emergency Replacement

**Situation:** Rahman’s 9-year-old wheel loader had major transmission failure during peak construction season. Repair would cost RM 95,000 and take 8 weeks.

He had contracts to supply 2,400 tons of aggregate over the next month.

**Bank Timeline:** 4-5 weeks for loan approval
**Our Timeline:** 36 hours from application to approval

**Outcome:** Rahman got a replacement wheel loader in 3 days, fulfilled all contracts, and earned RM 78,000 profit instead of losing customers to competitors.

**When your quarry can’t wait, we don’t make you wait.**

## Conclusion: Stop Renting, Start Building Your Quarry Empire

Every month you continue renting is another month of building the rental company’s wealth instead of your own quarry empire.

Every ton of aggregate you load with rented equipment is a missed opportunity to build asset value.

Every time equipment isn’t available when peak demand hits, you lose money and customers to competitors.

**The solution is ownership: Own your wheel loader.**

With **0% deposit financing** and **100% financing options**, there’s no financial barrier to ownership. With our **fast approval process**, there’s no time barrier either.

**The only question is: Will you keep enriching rental companies, or start building your own quarry empire?**

**Contact Ing Heng Credit today and transform from renter to owner.**

**Your wheel loader. Your schedule. Your quarry profits. Your empire.**
