The 77% Problem: Efficiency, Not Shortage
          

          


            Malaysia's logistics industry faces a misunderstood challenge. While reports highlight **15-20% driver turnover**, the real issue is **77% empty backloads** - lorries returning empty after deliveries. This indicates an efficiency problem, not an absolute driver shortage.
          



          


            According to IRU Global Report 2024 and workforce consultant analyses, Malaysia's challenge is **driver utilization**, not driver numbers. The high empty backload rate shows that existing drivers and vehicles aren't being optimized effectively.
          



          
            
              The Real Problem

                **77% empty backloads** - Massive revenue loss per trip
- 
                  
                
                **Not a driver shortage** - It's a utilization and routing issue
- 
                  
                
                **Technology adoption** - Route optimization software available
- 
                  
                
                **Load consolidation** - Platforms to fill return trips


          

          
            Why Lorry Ownership Solves the Problem
          

          
            When you own your lorry through financing, you gain complete control over operations. This control lets you implement solutions that employed drivers or rental operators cannot:

#### Route Optimization Control


                

Plan routes that maximize return loads. You decide which deliveries to accept based on round-trip profitability, not just one-way rates.

#### Backhaul Contract Freedom


                

Negotiate directly with shippers for return loads. No dispatcher taking a cut of your backhaul profits.

#### Load Platform Access


                

Use digital load boards and consolidation platforms. You control which loads you accept and when you work.

#### Technology Investment


                

Install GPS tracking and route optimization software. Ownership lets you choose and implement efficiency tools.
