## Executive Summary: Don't Guess, Calculate

**The Problem:**
"The salesman said 3% interest, but my monthly payment feels like 6%."
This happens when you confuse **Flat Rate** with **Reducing Balance Rate** (Effective Rate).

**The Solution:**
Learn the formula.
*   **Flat Rate:** Used for machinery Hire Purchase. Simple interest on the original loan amount.
*   **Reducing Balance:** Used for housing loans. Interest on the outstanding balance.

**Key Insight:**
A **3.5% Flat Rate** is roughly equal to a **6.5% Reducing Balance Rate**.
Always ask: "Is this Flat Rate p.a.?"

**Verdict:** Use our formula below to double-check any quote.

## 1. The Flat Rate Formula (Hire Purchase)

This is the standard for 99% of machinery loans in Malaysia.

**Formula:**
`Monthly Installment = [(Loan Amount x Interest Rate x Years) + Loan Amount] / Total Months`

**Example:**
*   **Loan:** RM 100,000
*   **Rate:** 4.0% Flat p.a.
*   **Tenure:** 5 Years (60 Months)

*   **Total Interest:** RM 100,000 x 4% x 5 = RM 20,000
*   **Total Payable:** RM 100,000 + RM 20,000 = RM 120,000
*   **Monthly:** RM 120,000 / 60 = **RM 2,000**

## 2. The Rule of 78 (Early Settlement)

"If I pay off the loan early, do I save interest?"
**Yes, but not as much as you think.**

Machinery loans use the **Rule of 78** (Sum of Digits) to calculate rebate.
*   You pay more interest in the early months.
*   Example: In Month 10 of a 60-month loan, you have paid mostly interest, very little principal.

**Strategy:**
If you plan to settle early, do it in the **first half** of the tenure to get a meaningful rebate.

## 3. Comparing Quotes: The EIR Trap

Bank A offers **3.5% Flat**. Bank B offers **6.0% Reducing Balance**. Which is cheaper?

*   **Bank A:** RM 100k Loan, 5 Years. Monthly = **RM 1,958**. (Total Paid: RM 117,500).
*   **Bank B:** RM 100k Loan, 5 Years. Monthly = **RM 1,933**. (Total Paid: RM 116,000).

**Result:** Bank B (6.0% Reducing) is actually **cheaper** than Bank A (3.5% Flat).
Always convert to Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to compare apples to apples.

## 4. Hidden Fees to Watch Out For

The monthly installment isn't the only cost.
1.  **Processing Fee:** RM 500 - RM 2,000 (One-off).
2.  **Stamp Duty:** 0.5% of Loan Amount.
3.  **Insurance:** Annual premium (RM 2k - 5k).
4.  **Late Payment Fee:** 8% p.a. on overdue amount.

**Tip:** Ask for the "All-in Cost" including fees.
