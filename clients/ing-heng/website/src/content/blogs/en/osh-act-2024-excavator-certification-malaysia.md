What Changed in OSH Act 2024?
          

          


            The Occupational Safety and Health Act amendments effective **June 1, 2024** represent the most significant regulatory overhaul in Malaysian construction safety history. For excavator contractors, these changes are not optional—they directly impact your ability to operate legally.
          



          
            
              Critical Changes for Excavator Contractors
            
            

- 
                  


                
                **Stricter employer duties** - Employers now personally liable for equipment safety compliance
- 
                  
                
                **Increased penalties** - Fines up to RM100,000 + 2 years imprisonment per violation
- 
                  
                
                **Mandatory operator certification** - All excavator operators must have valid competency documentation
- 
                  
                
                **Equipment safety standards** - Older excavators must meet current safety feature requirements


          

          
            Does Your Excavator Meet 2024 Safety Standards?
          

          
            If your excavator was manufactured before 2020, there's a significant chance it may not fully comply with the new OSH Act 2024 requirements. Many older machines lack critical safety features that are now mandatory.
          



          
            
              Mandatory Safety Features Under OSH Act 2024
            
            
              
                
                  
                    


                  
                  **ROPS (Rollover Protection)**
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                  **FOPS (Falling Object Protection)**
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                  **Emergency Shutdown System**
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                  **Reversing Alarms & Cameras**
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                  **Seat Belt Interlocks**
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                  **Hydraulic Safety Locks**
                
              
            
          

          
            **The problem:** Retrofitting these features to an older excavator often costs more than the machine is worth. Many contractors discover that upgrading to a newer, compliant excavator is more cost-effective than modifying their existing fleet.
          



          
            Operator Certification Requirements
          

          


            Under OSH Act 2024, it's no longer enough to simply "have experienced operators." You must documented proof of competency for every excavator operator on your team.
          



          
            
              Required Operator Certifications
            
            

1. 1
                
                  **CIDB Construction Personnel Card**
                  

Green Card (basic) or Red Card (skilled operator) - Mandatory for all construction sites


                
2. 2
                
                  **DOSH Machinery Registration**
                  

DOSH registration for excavator operation - Updated annually


                
3. 3
                
                  **Accredited Training Certificate**
                  

Certificate from CIDB or DOSH-accredited training provider


                
4. 4
                
                  **Medical Fitness Certificate**
                  

Valid medical certificate confirming physical fitness for heavy equipment operation


                


          

          


            **Employer responsibility:** OSH Act 2024 makes *you* personally responsible for ensuring all operators are properly certified. If an un-certified operator has an accident, the business owner faces criminal liability—not just the company.
          



          
            Financing Your Path to OSH 2024 Compliance
          

          


            Here's the reality: Upgrading your excavator fleet to meet OSH Act 2024 standards is a significant investment. But the cost of non-compliance—fines, project stoppages, legal liability—is far higher.
