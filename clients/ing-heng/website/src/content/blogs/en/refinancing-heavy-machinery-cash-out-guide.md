## Executive Summary: Your Machine is a Bank

**The Problem:**
You have a fleet of 5 excavators fully paid off, but your bank account is empty. You need cash for a new project deposit (RM 200k).
Banks won't give you a clean loan because your P&L looks weak this year.

**The Solution:**
**Refinancing (Cash Out).**
Use your paid-off machines as collateral to get a loan.
*   **Loan Amount:** Up to 80% of current market value.
*   **Speed:** Cash in 3-5 days.
*   **Usage:** Any purpose (Working Capital, Pay Suppliers, Buy Materials).

**Verdict:** The fastest way to raise capital without selling your assets.

## 1. How Refinancing Works

It's simple. You "sell" the machine to us, and we "lease" it back to you.
1.  **Valuation:** We check the market value of your excavator (e.g., RM 200,000).
2.  **Offer:** We lend you 70% - 80% (RM 140,000 - RM 160,000).
3.  **Transfer:** You transfer ownership (Grant/E-Batal) to Ing Heng temporarily.
4.  **Cash Out:** You get RM 160,000 cash.
5.  **Repayment:** You pay monthly installments over 2-3 years.
6.  **Ownership Return:** Once paid off, ownership transfers back to you.

## 2. Eligibility Criteria for Refinancing

Not every machine qualifies.

| Criteria | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Machine Age** | Max 15 Years Old |
| **Ownership** | Fully Paid (No outstanding loan) |
| **Condition** | Must be in working order |
| **Documentation** | Original Grant / Invoice proof of purchase |
| **Company** | Sdn Bhd or Enterprise active > 1 year |

**Note:** If you still owe a small amount to another bank (e.g., RM 20k left on a RM 200k machine), we can settle it for you and refinance the balance.

## 3. Interest Rates & Tenure

Refinancing rates are slightly higher than new purchase loans because it's considered "Cash Out."
*   **Interest Rate:** 5.5% - 7.5% p.a. (Flat).
*   **Tenure:** 2 - 4 Years max.

**Is it worth it?**
Compare it to a Personal Loan (8% - 12%) or Credit Card (18%). Machinery refinancing is much cheaper.
