## Why Prime Movers Are Essential for Port Klang Operations

### Malaysia’s Largest Port

Port Klang handles:

• **13.2 million TEUs annually** (2024 figures)

• 70% of Malaysia’s container traffic

• Over 6,000 vessels per year

• Major shipping lines: Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, COSCO, Evergreen

**This creates massive demand for:**

• Container haulage from port to inland depots

• Empty container repositioning

• Cross-border transport (Thailand, Singapore)

• Factory-to-port delivery

• Import/export logistics

### Types of Port Klang Operations

**1. Port-to-Depot Container Transport**

• Northport to inland container depots (Nilai, Banting, Shah Alam)

• Westport to logistics parks (Port Klang Free Zone)

• Empty container returns

• Daily hauling contracts

**2. Import/Export Logistics**

• Factory to port delivery (electronics, automotive parts)

• Port to warehouse distribution

• Cross-docking operations

• Time-sensitive cargo

**3. Cross-Border Transport**

• Port Klang to Penang (Butterworth Port)

• Port Klang to Singapore (PSA, Tuas)

• Port Klang to Thailand (Hat Yai, Bangkok)

• Regional container movements

**4. Specialized Cargo**

• Refrigerated containers (reefers)

• Hazardous materials transport

• Oversized cargo movements

• High-value goods

### Why You Need to Own Your Prime Mover

**Rental limitations:**

• RM400-600 per day rental costs

• Availability issues during peak season

• No control over equipment condition

• Can’t build company assets

• Higher long-term costs

**Ownership benefits:**

• **0% deposit financing available**

• Build company asset value

• Take any contract (24/7 availability)

• Lower cost per trip

• Depreciation tax benefits

• Better profit margins

## Port Klang Logistics Market Demand

### Current Industry Situation

**High demand for prime movers:**

• Port Klang container volume growing 5-7% annually

• Shortage of qualified transport operators

• Shipping lines prefer owned equipment (reliability)

• E-commerce boom driving import demand

• Manufacturing exports increasing

**Typical contract rates:**

• **Port to Shah Alam depot:** RM180-220 per container

• **Port to Nilai/Seremban:** RM250-300 per container

• **Port to Ipoh:** RM450-550 per container

• **Port to Singapore:** RM1,200-1,500 per container

• **Monthly contract rates:** RM25,000-40,000 per prime mover

**Average revenue per prime mover:**

• 2-3 trips per day (local hauling)

• RM400-600 daily revenue

• RM10,000-15,000 monthly revenue per unit

• 4-5 prime movers = RM40,000-75,000 monthly revenue

### ROI Calculation Example

**Scenario: 1 Scania R450 Prime Mover**

**Equipment cost:** RM500,000 (new)
**Financing:** 0% deposit, RM500,000 loan at 8% p.a., 60 months
**Monthly payment:** RM10,135

**Monthly revenue:**

• 2.5 trips per day × 25 working days = 62.5 trips

• Average RM200 per trip = RM12,500 gross revenue

**Monthly costs:**

• Loan payment: RM10,135

• Diesel: RM3,500

• Maintenance: RM800

• Insurance: RM600

• Driver salary: RM3,500

• Road tax: RM150

• **Total costs:** RM18,685

**Net profit:** RM12,500 - RM18,685 = **Break-even in first year**

**Year 2 onwards (after optimizing routes):**

• 3 trips per day = 75 trips × RM200 = RM15,000 revenue

• Same costs: RM18,685

• **Net profit improves to RM-3,685** (still building efficiency)

**Year 3 onwards (established routes):**

• 3 trips × RM220 (better rates) = RM16,500 revenue

• **Profitable operations with asset building**

**After 5 years:**

• Own prime mover outright (RM0 loan payment)

• Monthly costs drop to RM8,550

• Revenue: RM16,500+

• **Monthly profit: RM7,950+**

• Resale value: RM200,000-250,000 (well-maintained unit)

**With 0% deposit financing:**

• Preserve RM500,000 working capital

• Use cash for operations, fuel, driver salaries

• Build fleet faster (buy 2nd unit sooner)

• Better cash flow management
