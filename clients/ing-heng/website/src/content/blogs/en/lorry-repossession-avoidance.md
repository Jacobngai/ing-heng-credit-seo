Understanding Lorry Repossession in Malaysia
          

          


            Every logistics business faces cash flow challenges. Seasonal dips, delayed client payments, or unexpected repairs can make it difficult to meet lorry installment commitments. Understanding how repossession works and planning ahead can protect your business assets.

- Day 1-30
                **Payment Missed** - Late fee charged (typically 5-10% of installment)
- Day 31-60
                **Second Missed Payment** - Reminder notices sent, penalty increases
- Day 61-90
                **Third Missed Payment** - Default notice issued, repossession proceedings begin
- Day 90+
                **Legal Action** - Court order obtained, lorry seized, auctioned


          

          
            Smart Installment Planning Strategies
          

          

### 1. Match Installments to Cash Flow Cycles



          


            Logistics businesses have seasonal patterns. Chinese New Year (January-February), Hari Raya (April-May), and year-end holidays (November-December) all impact cash flow differently.
          



          
            

#### Pro Tip: Seasonal Installment Adjustment


            


              Request seasonal installment restructuring from your financier:
            


            

- **CNY (Jan-Feb):** Lower installments or payment holiday for 2 weeks
- **Hari Raya (Apr-May):** Reduced payment during Raya month
- **Year-End (Nov-Dec):** Smaller installment during 11.11/12.12 slowdown
- **Catch-Up Periods:** Slightly higher payments during peak months


          

          

### 2. Build an Emergency Fund



          


            Set aside 3 months of lorry installment payments in a separate account. This creates a buffer for unexpected delays or emergency repairs.
          



          
            

#### Emergency Fund Calculation


            


              **Example:** If your monthly lorry installment is RM 3,000, maintain RM 9,000 (3 months) as emergency reserve. This fund should only be used for installment payments during genuine cash flow crises.
            


          

          

### 3. Choose the Right Tenure



          


            Longer tenure means lower monthly installments but higher total interest. Shorter tenure saves interest but increases monthly burden. Find the right balance based on your business's average monthly income.

                  5 Years
                  RM 3,933
                  RM 36,000
                
                
                  7 Years
                  RM 2,907
                  RM 50,400
                
                
                  9 Years
                  RM 2,378
                  RM 64,800
                
              
            
          

          
            What to Do If You Can't Pay
          

          

### Step 1: Contact Your Financer Immediately



          


            Don't avoid calls or ignore letters. Financiers prefer working with you to find a solution rather than repossessing. Early communication shows good faith and increases options.
          



          

### Step 2: Discuss Restructuring Options



          

- **Tenure Extension:** Extend loan period to reduce monthly installment
- **Payment Holiday:** Temporary payment pause (1-3 months) with added tenure
- **Partial Payment:** Pay what you can afford to show commitment
- **Refinancing:** New loan with better terms to settle existing loan



          

### Step 3: Generate Quick Cash Flow



          
            

#### Emergency Cash Generation Strategies


            

- **Invoice Factoring:** Sell unpaid invoices to get immediate cash (70-90% of invoice value)
- **Express Delivery Jobs:** Take higher-margin urgent deliveries
- **Sub-Contracting:** Rent out your lorry to other operators
- **Backload Optimization:** Fill return trips with cargo (addresses 77% empty backload issue)
- **Temporary Downgrade:** Switch to shorter routes or lighter cargo temporarily


          

          
            Restructuring vs. Refinancing: Which Option?
          

          
            
              

#### Restructuring


              

- Modify existing loan terms
- No new loan application
- Lower monthly payments
- Longer tenure (more interest)
- Same financier relationship


            
            
              

#### Refinancing


              

- New loan pays off old loan
- New application required
- Potentially better interest rate
- Cash-out option possible
- Switch financiers if needed


            
          

          
            Legal Rights: What Financiers Must Do
          

          


            Malaysia's Hire Purchase Act 1967 protects consumers. Financiers must follow legal procedures before repossessing your lorry:
          



          
            

#### Required Legal Steps


            

1. **1. Fourth Schedule Notice:** Written notice of default sent to registered address
2. **2. 14-Day Grace Period:** You have 14+ days to settle arrears before repossession
3. **3. Possession Notice:** If repossessed, notice sent within 21 days
4. **4. Auction Notice:** Intent to auction must be advertised and notified
5. **5. Surplus Return:** Any auction surplus after settlement must be returned
