**Quick Summary:** Hire purchase builds equity and offers ownership benefits (higher payments), while operating lease provides flexibility and lower monthly costs (no ownership). Choose based on your cash flow, fleet strategy, and long-term business goals.
          


        

        

## Understanding the Two Options



        

### What is Lorry Hire Purchase?



        


          **Hire Purchase (Sewa Beli)** is a financing arrangement where you:
        



        

- Pay an initial deposit (0-10% with Ing Heng Credit)
- Make fixed monthly installments over 5-9 years
- Gain full ownership after the final payment
- Build equity in the asset throughout the term



        


          The lorry is legally yours after completing all payments. You're responsible for maintenance, insurance, and any modifications needed for your logistics operations.
        



        

### What is Operating Lease?



        


          **Operating Lease** is essentially a long-term rental where you:
        



        

- Pay lower monthly "rental" payments
- Use the lorry for a fixed period (3-5 years)
- Return the vehicle at end of term (no ownership)
- May include maintenance packages



        


          The leasing company retains ownership. You have usage rights but no equity buildup. This is often called "contract hire" in the logistics industry.

                  {row.operatingLease}
                  
                    
                      {row.winner}
                    
                  
                
              ))}
            
          
        

        

## Cash Flow Impact Analysis



        


          Understanding the cash flow implications is critical for logistics companies, especially with diesel prices at **RM3.35/litre** (up 55% since June 2024).
        



        

### Hire Purchase Cash Flow



        
          

Example: RM150,000 Lorry (7-Year Hire Purchase)


          

- **Down Payment (0%):** RM0
- **Monthly Installment:** ~RM2,200 (at 3.5% interest)
- **Total Payment Over 7 Years:** ~RM184,800
- **Asset Value at End:** ~RM30,000-50,000 (resale)


        

        

### Operating Lease Cash Flow



        
          

Example: RM150,000 Lorry (4-Year Operating Lease)


          

- **Initial Deposit:** RM6,250 (2.5 months)
- **Monthly Rental:** ~RM2,500
- **Total Payment Over 4 Years:** ~RM126,250
- **Asset Value at End:** RM0 (return vehicle)


        

        


          *Key Insight:* Operating lease has higher monthly payments in this example but shorter commitment and no residual value risk. Hire purchase builds equity but requires longer commitment.
        



        

## Tax Benefits Comparison



        


          Both options offer tax advantages for Malaysian logistics companies, but structured differently:
        



        

### Hire Purchase Tax Benefits



        

- **Capital Allowance:** Claim depreciation on asset value (20% initial + 20% annual allowance)
- **Interest Deduction:** 100% of interest paid is tax-deductible business expense
- **Option to Capitalize:** Can claim full purchase price over multiple years



        

### Operating Lease Tax Benefits



        

- **Full Rental Deduction:** 100% of monthly rental payments are tax-deductible
- **Simpler Accounting:** No need to track depreciation or capital allowances
- **Immediate Expense:** Entire payment reduces taxable income in same year



        
          

#### Tax Planning Tip


          


            Consult your tax advisor to model which option provides better after-tax cash flow based on your company's tax bracket, profit margins, and financial strategy.
          


        

        

## Which Option Suits Your Logistics Business?



        


          The right choice depends on your specific operational needs, financial situation, and growth strategy. Here are common scenarios:
        



        
          {useCases.map((useCase) => (
            
              
                {useCase.icon}
                

#### {useCase.scenario}


              
              
                
                  {useCase.recommendation}
                
              
              

{useCase.reason}


            
          ))}
        

        

## Port Klang & Cross-Border Considerations



        


          With Port Klang handling **14.64 million TEUs** in 2024 and the ASEAN Customs Transit System launching April 2025, cross-border logistics operators have unique considerations:
        



        

### For Cross-Border Operations



        


          **Recommendation: Hire Purchase**
        



        

- Full control for APAD permit modifications
- No restrictions on GPS system installation
- Can customize for Singapore/Thailand border requirements
- Long-term asset for established international routes



        

### For Port Klang Last-Mile Delivery



        


          **Recommendation: Operating Lease (or mixed fleet)**
        



        

- Flexibility to scale during peak seasons (CNY, 11.11)
- Lower commitment for variable demand routes
- Can add/return vehicles based on container volumes
- Maintenance often included (reduce downtime)



        

## Diesel Price Impact: RM3.35/Litre Reality



        


          Since diesel prices jumped 55% in June 2024, total cost of ownership matters more than ever:
        



        
          

#### Operating Cost Reality Check


          


            A typical 10-ton lorry consumes ~40 litres per 100km. At RM3.35/litre:
          


          

- **Per 100km:** RM134 in fuel costs
- **Per month (5,000km):** RM6,700 in fuel
- **Per year:** ~RM80,400 in fuel alone


        

        


          *Financing Implication:* With SKDS 2.0 fleet card, eligible operators can access subsidized diesel, but this requires owned or financed vehicles (not operating lease).
