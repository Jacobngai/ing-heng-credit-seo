## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Emergency Loan Questions

**Q: What makes this different from normal personal loans?**

A: Emergency home repair loans are processed on urgent basis with relaxed documentation requirements. While normal personal loans take 1-2 weeks, emergency loans are approved within hours. We prioritize genuine emergencies over strict credit requirements because delaying repairs often costs more than the loan interest.

**Q: Can I apply during weekends or public holidays?**

A: Yes! True emergencies don’t wait for working hours. Our emergency hotline (+60175700889) operates 24/7. Weekend applications are processed Monday morning for fund disbursement. For critical safety emergencies (electrical fires, gas leaks), we have standby approval authority even on holidays.

**Q: What if I need more money after repairs start?**

A: Additional financing is possible if:

• Original emergency justified immediate action

• Additional damage discovered during repairs

• Contractor finds more problems than initially visible

• Your income can support increased payment

We can top-up existing loans or approve supplementary emergency financing. Many home emergencies reveal hidden damage once work begins.

### Approval and Credit Questions

**Q: Will my bad credit history affect emergency approval?**

A: Emergency situations are evaluated differently than normal loans. While bad credit is considered, we focus on:

• Current income stability

• Genuineness of emergency

• Ability to make future payments

• Severity of repair needed

Many customers with past credit issues get approved because home emergencies are legitimate needs that require immediate action.

**Q: Can I apply if I already have other loans?**

A: Yes, provided your total monthly payments don’t exceed 60% of income. We calculate:

• Current loan payments

• New emergency loan payment

• Basic living expenses

• Available balance for new payment

If you’re overcommitted, we can suggest payment restructuring or smaller loan amounts to fit your budget.

**Q: Do I need a guarantor for emergency loans?**

A: Guarantor requirements depend on loan amount and risk factors:

• **Below RM30,000:** Usually no guarantor needed

• **RM30,000-RM80,000:** Guarantor recommended for bad credit

• **Above RM80,000:** Guarantor or collateral required

For genuine emergencies, we’re flexible on guarantor requirements and may waive if other factors compensate.

### Loan Terms and Repayment Questions

**Q: Can I settle the loan early without penalty?**

A: Yes! No penalty for early settlement. We encourage early repayment and offer rebates calculated using the ‘Rule of 78’ method. Early settlement saves you interest costs and improves your credit profile for future financing needs.

**Q: What happens if I can’t make monthly payments later?**

A: We understand financial difficulties arise. Options available:

• **Payment rescheduling:** Extend tenure to reduce monthly payment

• **Temporary payment reduction:** Lower payment for 3-6 months

• **Interest rate review:** Reduce rate after 12 months good payment

• **Refinancing:** Combine with other loans for better terms

Contact us immediately if payment difficulties arise. Early communication prevents bigger problems.

**Q: Are there any hidden charges or fees?**

A: No hidden charges. All fees disclosed upfront:

• Processing fee: RM500-RM800 (one-time)

• Valuation fee: RM300-RM500 (if required)

• Legal fees: RM1,000-RM2,000 (for property collateral)

• Stamp duty: Government rates (for loan agreements)

No monthly service charges, early settlement penalties, or insurance commission markups. What we quote is what you pay.

### Property and Contractor Questions

**Q: Can I use my own contractor or must I use yours?**

A: You can use any licensed contractor. However, we recommend our panel contractors because:

• Pre-verified for quality and reliability

• Competitive pricing (no markup for financing)

• Direct payment arrangements available

• Quality guarantee for work performed

If you prefer your own contractor, we need their business registration and quotation for approval.

**Q: What if the contractor disappears or does poor work?**

A: Protection measures in place:

• Progressive payment based on work completion

• Withhold final payment until work completion

• Warranty requirements for major repairs

• Legal recourse for contract breaches

For our panel contractors, we provide additional protection through our contractor evaluation and monitoring system.
