Understanding Diesel Subsidy Reform (June 2024)
          

          


            On **June 10, 2024**, the Malaysian government implemented a historic change to diesel pricing. The price jumped from RM2.15 to RM3.35 per litre in Peninsular Malaysia—an increase of **RM1.20 per litre (55.8% increase)**.
          



          


            For container hauliers, this was devastating:
          



          

- **Fuel represents 30-40% of operating costs** for haulage businesses
- **Prime movers consume significant diesel**—averaging 35L per 100km
- **Daily operations became much more expensive** overnight
- **Profit margins were severely squeezed** for many hauliers



          


            The government cited **RM14.3 billion in diesel subsidy costs for 2023** as the reason for reform, targeting leakages and ensuring subsidies reach intended recipients.

            Calculating Your Annual Savings
          

          
            Let's break down the actual savings for a typical prime mover operation:
          



          
            
              Prime Mover Fuel Savings Example
            
            

- **Average fuel consumption:** 35L per 100km
- **Daily distance:** 40 km (Port Klang operations)
- **Daily fuel use:** 14 litres
- **Daily savings:** 14L × RM1.20 = **RM16.80**
- **Monthly savings:** RM16.80 × 26 days = **RM437**
- **Annual savings:** RM437 × 12 months = **RM5,244**


            


              Note: Actual savings vary based on distance, fuel efficiency, and operations. Long-distance prime movers can save up to RM21,000 annually.
