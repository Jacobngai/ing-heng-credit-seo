# Excavator Financing for 10 Years Old Equipment: Complete Guide

Are you looking at a 10-year-old excavator but worried no one will finance it? You're not alone. Many contractors think equipment age limits financing options.

**Here's the truth: Age is just a number.**

At Ing Heng Credit & Leasing, we finance excavators up to 10 years old because we understand quality construction equipment. A well-maintained Caterpillar or Komatsu excavator built in 2016 still has 8-10 years of productive life remaining.

Banks reject older equipment automatically. We evaluate each excavator individually. If the machine is solid, we'll finance it—often with **0% deposit** available.

In this guide, you'll learn:
- Why 10-year-old excavators are smart investments
- Our evaluation criteria for older equipment
- Exact financing terms and interest rates
- Required documentation for approval
- How to strengthen your application
- Real examples of approved financing

Let's help you get that excavator.

## Why Finance a 10-Year-Old Excavator?

Many contractors overlook older equipment, thinking "new is better." But 10-year-old excavators offer compelling advantages.

### Financial Benefits

**Lower Purchase Price**
- New excavator (Komatsu PC200): RM 380,000-420,000
- 10-year-old model (2016): RM 120,000-160,000
- **Savings: RM 220,000-260,000**

**Lower Monthly Payments**
- New excavator: RM 7,500-8,500/month (60 months)
- 10-year-old: RM 3,200-4,500/month (36-48 months)
- **Save: RM 4,000-5,000 monthly**

**Faster ROI**
- Lower cost = Break even faster
- Same earning potential (RM 200-300/hour rental rate)
- Less debt burden on your business

### Equipment Quality Reality

**Modern excavators last 15-20 years with proper maintenance.**

**What matters more than age:**
- Maintenance history (serviced every 500 hours?)
- Operating hours (8,000 hours is mid-life, not end-of-life)
- Brand quality (Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi built to last)
- Storage conditions (covered shelter vs outdoor exposure)
- Operating environment (soft soil vs hard rock)

**Example:** A 2016 Caterpillar 320 with 8,000 hours and full service records is more reliable than a 2020 unknown brand with 6,000 hours and no maintenance history.

### Tax Advantages

**Capital allowances still available:**
- Used equipment qualifies for tax deductions
- Depreciation schedule based on purchase price
- Lower purchase price = lower annual depreciation (plan accordingly)

**Consult your tax advisor** for specifics based on your business structure.

## Our 10-Year-Old Equipment Policy

At Ing Heng Credit, we have clear criteria for financing older excavators.

### Equipment Age Limits

**Maximum Age: 10 years old**
- Year 2026: We finance excavators from 2016 onwards
- Year 2027: We'll finance excavators from 2017 onwards
- Calculated from manufacture year, not purchase year

**Why 10 years?**
- Equipment still has 8-10 years productive life
- Adequate resale value for collateral
- Lower risk of major mechanical failure

**Banks typically limit to 5 years** - This is why contractors come to us.

### Brand Preferences

**Tier 1 Brands (Easiest Approval, Best Terms):**
- Caterpillar
- Komatsu
- Hitachi
- Kobelco
- Volvo
- JCB

**Tier 2 Brands (Case-by-Case Evaluation):**
- Doosan
- Hyundai
- Case
- Liebherr
- SANY
- XCMG

**Why brand matters:**
- Resale value (Tier 1 retains 60-70% value after 10 years)
- Parts availability (easier maintenance)
- Reliability reputation
- Easier to re-sell if repossession needed

**Note:** We can finance Tier 2 brands—evaluation just considers resale value in terms.

### Operating Hours Consideration

**Ideal range: Under 12,000 hours**

**Why it matters:**
- 2,000 hours/year = normal usage (10 years = 20,000 hours expected)
- Under 12,000 hours = light to moderate use (good sign)
- 8,000-15,000 hours = typical range for 10-year excavator
- Over 15,000 hours = requires detailed inspection

**Example:**
- 2016 Komatsu PC200, 9,500 hours, full service records = Excellent condition
- 2016 unknown brand, 14,000 hours, no maintenance history = Higher risk

## How We Evaluate 10-Year-Old Excavators

Our assessment process is thorough but straightforward.

### Step 1: Document Review

**Required information:**
- Excavator make, model, year
- Current operating hours
- Maintenance history (service records)
- Current condition (photos from all angles)
- Seller information (dealer or private)
- Asking price

**Timeline:** Initial assessment within 24 hours

### Step 2: Physical Inspection

**What we check:**

**Visual Inspection:**
- Body condition (rust, cracks, collision damage)
- Undercarriage wear (tracks, rollers, sprockets)
- Bucket and boom condition
- Hydraulic leaks
- Paint condition (indicates care level)

**Functional Testing:**
- Engine start-up (smoke, noise, vibration)
- Hydraulic system response
- Slew ring operation
- All controls and gauges
- Safety features

**Documentation Verification:**
- Serial number matches paperwork
- No outstanding liens or loans
- Clear ownership transfer documents

**Timeline:** 1-2 days to arrange and complete

### Step 3: Valuation Assessment

**Market value determination:**
- Compare with recent sales of similar models
- Adjust for condition and hours
- Consider location and availability
- Verify seller's asking price is reasonable

**Loan-to-value ratio:**
- Maximum 100% of assessed value (not asking price)
- If seller asks RM 150K but we value at RM 130K, we finance RM 130K maximum
- You'd need to negotiate or pay difference

**Timeline:** Same day as inspection

### Step 4: Credit & Business Evaluation

**Your business assessment:**
- Current projects and revenue
- Business history and stability
- CCRIS/CTOS review (not automatic disqualification)
- Down payment capacity
- Cash flow analysis

**Timeline:** 1-2 business days

### Step 5: Approval Decision

**Possible outcomes:**

✅ **APPROVED (Standard Terms)**
- Excellent equipment + good credit
- 0-10% deposit
- Interest rate: 8-10% annually
- Tenure: 36-48 months

✅ **APPROVED (Adjusted Terms)**
- Good equipment + fair credit OR fair equipment + good credit
- 10-20% deposit
- Interest rate: 9-11% annually
- Tenure: 30-42 months

✅ **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**
- Approved pending repairs/service
- Approved with higher deposit
- Approved with shorter tenure

❌ **DECLINED (Rare)**
- Equipment value too low
- Major mechanical issues found
- Unable to verify ownership
- No business income verification

**Our approval rate for quality 10-year-old equipment: 90%+**

**Strong justification:**
- "I have RM 800K contract starting next month requiring excavator"
- "Currently renting at RM 5,000/month, costing RM 60K annually"
- "Expanding from mini excavator to medium size for larger projects"

**Weak justification:**
