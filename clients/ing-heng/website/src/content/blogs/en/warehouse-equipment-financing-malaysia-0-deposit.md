## 2. Cost Analysis: Setting Up a 20,000 sqft Warehouse

Let's break down the typical investment needed for a mid-sized warehouse in Shah Alam.

| Item | Quantity | Unit Cost (RM) | Total Cost (RM) | Monthly Installment (5 Years) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reach Truck (Electric)** | 2 | RM 120,000 | RM 240,000 | **RM 4,500** |
| **Power Pallet Truck** | 4 | RM 15,000 | RM 60,000 | **RM 1,125** |
| **Selective Racking (1000 Pallets)** | 1 Lot | RM 150,000 | RM 150,000 | **RM 2,813** |
| **Battery Chargers & Install** | 1 Lot | RM 20,000 | RM 20,000 | **RM 375** |
| **TOTAL INVESTMENT** | | | **RM 470,000** | **RM 8,813** |

**The Strategy:**
Instead of paying **RM 470,000 cash**, you finance 90% or 100%.
*   **Upfront Cost:** RM 0 - RM 47,000.
*   **Monthly Cost:** RM 8,813.

**Result:** You preserve RM 400k+ cash for inventory, marketing, and staff wages.

## 3. Why Finance Electric Forklifts? (Lithium-Ion Trend)

The shift to Lithium-Ion batteries is massive in 2026.
*   **Higher Upfront Cost:** A Li-ion forklift costs 20-30% more than Lead-Acid.
*   **Lower Operating Cost:** No maintenance, faster charging, longer life (5+ years).

**Financing Benefit:**
Financing spreads the higher upfront cost over 5 years. The monthly savings on electricity and maintenance often cover a significant portion of the installment.

**Tax Incentive:**
Electric MHE qualifies for **Green Technology Financing Scheme (GTFS)** rebates (2% interest subsidy) and Capital Allowances.

## 4. Racking System Financing: A Unique Challenge

Most banks view racking as "furniture" or "renovation" and won't finance it under Hire Purchase. They ask for a Term Loan (Clean Loan) with higher interest.

**Ing Heng Difference:**
We understand racking is an asset.
*   We can bundle racking financing with your MHE loan.
*   Or structure it as a separate equipment lease.
*   **Collateral:** The racking itself is the collateral (it can be dismantled and sold).

## 5. 0% Deposit Scheme for Logistics SMEs

If you have a contract with a major e-commerce platform (Shopee Express, Lazada Logistics, Ninja Van), you are a prime candidate.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Contract / Vendor Agreement:** Proof of business relationship.
2.  **6 Months Bank Statement:** Showing consistent payment from the principal.
3.  **Director Guarantee:** Personal guarantee from company directors.

**Benefit:**
Get a fleet of 10 forklifts with **RM 0 Down Payment**. Use the contract revenue to pay the monthly installments.

## 6. Used Forklift Financing

For startups or low-usage warehouses, used equipment is a smart choice.
*   **Reconditioned Toyota 8-Series (Japan Import):** Very popular. High reliability.
*   **Price:** RM 35,000 - RM 50,000 (vs RM 100k New).
*   **Financing:** We finance used units up to **10-15 years old**.

**Tip:** Always check the battery condition if buying used electric forklifts. A new battery costs RM 15,000+.

## Conclusion

Your warehouse efficiency defines your customer satisfaction. Late shipments due to equipment failure kill your business.
Invest in reliable, modern material handling equipment. Use financing to make it affordable.
