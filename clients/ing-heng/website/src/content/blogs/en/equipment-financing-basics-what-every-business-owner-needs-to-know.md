## Executive Summary: The 30-Second Guide to Equipment Financing

**What is it?** A loan specifically for buying business machinery (excavators, lorries, manufacturing lines) where the equipment itself serves as collateral.

**Why use it?** To preserve your cash flow. Instead of paying RM 300,000 upfront for a new excavator, you pay a small monthly installment (e.g., RM 5,500) and use the machine to earn profit immediately.

**Key Benefits in 2026:**
*   **0% Down Payment:** Available for qualified SMEs (exclusive to Ing Heng Credit).
*   **Tax Deductions:** Interest payments are tax-deductible expenses.
*   **Ownership:** You own the asset at the end of the tenure (unlike leasing).

**Quick Verdict:** If your business needs machinery to grow but you don't want to drain your bank account, equipment financing is the smartest financial tool available.

## 1. What is Equipment Financing?

Equipment financing is a type of business loan designed specifically for purchasing physical assets. Unlike a generic personal loan or a clean working capital loan, equipment financing is "secured." This means the machinery you buy acts as the security for the bank or credit company.

Because it is secured, approval is generally **faster** and interest rates are **lower** than unsecured business loans.

### Common Equipment Financed in Malaysia:
*   **Construction:** Excavators (Kobelco, Hitachi), Backhoes (JCB, Case), Cranes.
*   **Logistics:** Prime Movers (Volvo, Scania), Lorries (Isuzu, Hino), Trailers.
*   **Manufacturing:** CNC Machines, Production Lines, Injection Molding Machines.
*   **Agriculture:** Tractors (Kubota, Massey Ferguson), Harvesters.

> **Pro Tip:** At Ing Heng Credit, we finance **used equipment** up to 20 years old. Most banks stop at 5-7 years.

## 2. Types of Equipment Financing in Malaysia

Understanding the different structures can save you thousands in interest and tax payments.

| Financing Type | Ownership | Down Payment | Monthly Payment | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hire Purchase (HP)** | You own it after final payment | 0% - 20% | Fixed | Long-term usage (5+ years). Best for building assets. |
| **Industrial Hire Purchase (IHP)** | You own it (Business specific) | 10% - 20% | Fixed | Manufacturing & Construction SMEs claiming Capital Allowances. |
| **Operating Lease** | Lessor owns it | 2 Months Rental | Fixed (Rental) | Short-term projects (1-2 years) or off-balance sheet needs. |
| **Term Loan** | You own it immediately | Variable | Variable | specific project financing or bundling multiple assets. |

**Which one should you choose?**
For 90% of Malaysian SMEs, **Hire Purchase (HP)** is the best option. It offers the lowest interest rates and allows you to claim Capital Allowances (capital depreciation) to reduce your corporate tax.

## 3. Interest Rates & Costs (2026 Market Rates)

Interest rates for equipment financing are competitive compared to other business loans.

*   **New Equipment:** 3.5% - 5.5% p.a. (Flat Rate)
*   **Used Equipment (< 5 years):** 4.5% - 6.5% p.a.
*   **Older Equipment (> 10 years):** 6.0% - 8.0% p.a.

### The Hidden Cost: Effective Interest Rate (EIR)
Be careful when comparing "Flat Rates" vs. "Reducing Balance Rates." A 4% Flat Rate is roughly equivalent to a 7.5% Reducing Balance rate. Always ask your banker or credit officer for the effective rate.

**Example Calculation:**
Buying a **Used Kobelco Excavator** for **RM 150,000**.
*   **Tenure:** 5 Years
*   **Interest:** 5% p.a. (Flat)
*   **Monthly Installment:** RM 3,125

## 4. How to Qualify: The "4 C's" of Credit

Banks like Maybank, Public Bank, and CIMB use strict criteria. As a private credit company, Ing Heng Credit is more flexible, but the principles remain similar.

### 1. Capacity (Cash Flow)
Can your business afford the monthly installment? We look at your **6-months bank statements**.
*   *Requirement:* Average monthly credit turnover should cover the installment by 2-3 times.

### 2. Character (Credit History)
How have you paid past debts?
*   **CCRIS:** Shows payment behavior for bank loans. 1-2 months late is usually okay for us, but banks will reject.
*   **CTOS:** Shows legal cases or trade debts. Small Telco bills are ignored by us.

### 3. Capital (Down Payment)
Do you have "skin in the game"?
*   **Banks:** Strictly require 20-30% down payment.
*   **Ing Heng:** We offer **0% Down Payment** schemes for strong profiles, allowing you to keep your cash for operations.

### 4. Collateral (The Equipment)
Is the machine valuable?
*   We value recognized brands like **Caterpillar, Komatsu, Toyota, and Isuzu** higher.
*   Obscure Chinese brands may require a higher down payment due to lower resale value.

## 5. The Application Process: Step-by-Step

Getting approved doesn't have to be a headache. Here is the streamlined process at Ing Heng Credit:

1.  **Select Your Equipment:** Find the machine you need from a dealer or seller.
2.  **Submit Documents:**
    *   SSM (Business Registration)
    *   Director IC
    *   6 Months Bank Statements
    *   Quotation of Equipment
3.  **Site Visit:** We visit your office or yard (usually within 24 hours).
4.  **Approval:** Receive your Offer Letter (LO) within **2-3 days**.
5.  **Disbursement:** We pay the supplier, and the machine is delivered to you.

## 6. Why Choose Ing Heng Credit vs. Banks?

| Feature | Commercial Banks | Ing Heng Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Approval Speed** | 2 - 4 Weeks | **2 - 3 Days** |
| **Equipment Age Limit** | Max 10 Years | **No Age Limit (Review)** |
| **Down Payment** | Min 20% | **0% Available** |

**The Ing Heng Advantage:**
We have been in the market for **40+ years**. We understand that a construction project won't wait 4 weeks for a bank loan. If you need a crane or excavator *now* to start work next week, we are your best partner.

## 7. Expert Tips for Fast Approval

*   **Maintain a healthy bank balance:** Try not to let your account drop to zero at month-end.
*   **Clear small CTOS debts:** Pay off that old RM 200 Telco bill. It improves your score significantly.
*   **Choose popular models:** Financing a Toyota Forklift is easier than an unknown brand because the asset value is stable.
*   **Prepare a project contract:** If you are buying a machine for a specific awarded project, show us the Letter of Award (LOA). It proves you have income coming in.
