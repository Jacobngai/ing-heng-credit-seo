## The Big Three: Choosing Your Prime Mover Brand



      

You're starting a haulage business serving Port Klang. You need prime movers. Three brands dominate the Malaysian market: Volvo, Scania, Mercedes-Benz.



      

Each has advantages. Each has loyalists. But which offers the best value for your financing ringgit?

## Financing Approval Rates



      

### Bank Approval Rates by Brand



      

Banks prefer certain brands based on resale value and reliability:



      

**Scania:** 85-90% approval rate (highest resale value)
      
**Volvo:** 80-85% approval rate (strong brand reputation)
      
**Mercedes-Benz:** 75-80% approval rate (lower resale value)



      

### Ing Heng Credit Approval Rates



      

We approve all three brands at similar rates because we focus on:



      

- Your cash flow (not just brand)
- Maintenance history (well-maintained = reliable asset)
- Contract quality (revenue source matters more than brand)
- Your business track record (proven operators = preferred)



      

**Our Approval Rates:** 90-95% across all three brands (when business fundamentals are strong)



      

## Application-Specific Recommendations



      

### Port Klang Container Haulage



      

**Recommended:** Scania R450
      
**Why:**
      
• Best fuel efficiency (frequent starts/stops at port)
      
• Highest resale value (port haulage maintains value)
      
• Strong torque (heavy container loads)



      

### Long-Distance Haulage (KL-Penang, KL-Kelantan)



      

**Recommended:** Volvo FH16
      
**Why:**
      
• Driver comfort (long-haul driver retention)
      
• Reliability (less breakdown on highways)
      
• Safety features (accident prevention)



      

### Regional Distribution (Klang Valley, Short Haul)



      

**Recommended:** Mercedes-Benz Actros
      
**Why:**
      
• Lower purchase price (shorter routes justify lower capital)
      
• Lowest maintenance (frequent stops = more wear)
      
• Good maneuverability (urban delivery)



      

## Used vs New: Brand-Specific Considerations



      

### Used Volvo: Best Value?



      

**Advantages:**
      
• Premium brand at discounted price
      
• Reliable engineering (even with high mileage)
      
• Good parts availability



      

**Considerations:**
      
• Maintenance costs rise sharply after 5 years
      
• Electronic systems may need updates



      

### Used Scania: High Resale Value Retention



      

**Advantages:**
      
• Best resale value (holds price even used)
      
• Fuel-efficient (newer models)
      
• Strong demand for used Scanias



      

**Considerations:**
      
• Highest used prices (premium for brand)
      
• Maintenance most expensive of all three



      

### Used Mercedes-Benz: Budget Entry



      

**Advantages:**
      
• Lowest used prices
      
• Lowest maintenance costs
      
• Widely available



      

**Considerations:**
      
• Fastest depreciation
      
• Lower resale value at end of life

**New and Used:** We finance prime movers up to 10 years old.



      

### 2. 0% Down Payment on Any Brand



      

Brand choice shouldn't be dictated by down payment availability:



      

**0% Down Payment Applies Equally:**
      
• Volvo at RM500,000: RM0 down
      
• Scania at RM490,000: RM0 down

• Single units or fleet acquisitions



      

### 4. Mixed Brand Fleet Financing



      

Many haulage companies mix brands:



      

**Example Fleet:**
      
• 3 Scania (long-haul, heavy containers)
      
• 2 Volvo (regional distribution)
      
• 2 Mercedes (port drayage, shorter routes)



      

We finance mixed fleets. Single financing agreement covering multiple brands.



      

## Real-World Brand Choice Stories



      

### Port Klang Specialist



      

\"Started with Mercedes—lowest price. Good for startup. 3 years later, expanded to 5 prime movers. Calculated TCO: Scania had better resale value and fuel efficiency. Replaced Mercedes with Scanias over 2 years. Higher purchase price but lower operating costs. Net profit increased 15%. Ing Heng financed transition—0% down on new Scanias, traded in Mercedes. Brand choice matters for long-term profitability, not just initial price.\"


      

*— Zainal Abidin, Operations Director*



      

### Long-Distance Haulage



      

\"KL-Kelantan route. Mountain terrain, heavy loads. Started with Volvo—driver comfort critical for long-haul retention. Drivers stayed loyal, turnover low. Competitors used cheaper brands but had 50% driver turnover. Our Volvo drivers stayed 3+ years. Consistent service quality won premium contracts. Volvo premium paid for itself in driver retention and client satisfaction. Ing Heng financed Volvos at 0% down—preserved capital for driver training and competitive salaries.\"


      

*— Ahmad Zaki, Fleet Manager*



      

## Decision Framework: Which Brand for You?



      

### Step 1: Define Your Application



      

Consider:
      
• Route type (port, long-haul, regional)
      
• Typical load weight
      
• Annual distance
      
• Driver availability/turnover



      

### Step 2: Calculate 5-Year TCO



      

For each brand:
      
• Purchase price
      
• Fuel cost (based on consumption)
      
• Maintenance cost
      
• Resale value
      
**Choose lowest total cost, not lowest purchase price.**



      

### Step 3: Consider Financing Impact



      

Calculate:
      
• Down payment required (0% with Ing Heng)
      
• Monthly installment
      
• Total interest paid
      
• Impact on cash flow



      

### Step 4: Factor Non-Financial Considerations



      

Evaluate:
      
• Driver preference (comfort affects retention)
      
• Service center availability
      
• Parts availability
      
• Brand reputation with your clients



      

## The Bottom Line: Right Brand for Right Application



      

There's no single "best" prime mover brand. The right choice depends on:



      

- **Scania:** Best for port haulage, heavy containers, resale value focus
- **Volvo:** Best for long-haul, driver retention, safety focus
- **Mercedes-Benz:** Best for regional distribution, budget-sensitive operations



      

0% down payment financing allows you to choose based on TCO, not capital constraints. Fast approval deploys your chosen brand immediately.



      

Choose the brand that maximizes your profitability. We'll finance it.
