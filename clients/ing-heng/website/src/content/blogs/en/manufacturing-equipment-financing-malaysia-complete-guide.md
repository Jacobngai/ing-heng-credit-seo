## Executive Summary: Automate or Stagnate

**The Reality:**
Malaysian manufacturers face rising labor costs (minimum wage RM 1,700+) and fierce competition from Vietnam and Indonesia. The only way to survive is automation.

**The Barrier:**
High-tech machinery (CNC, Robotics) requires massive upfront capital. A 5-axis CNC machine costs RM 500,000+.

**The Solution:**
Manufacturing Equipment Financing (Industrial Hire Purchase). Acquire the technology today, pay over 5 years from the increased productivity.

**Verdict:** Don't let cash flow limit your output. Financing allows you to compete with global players by upgrading your factory floor immediately.

## 1. What Manufacturing Equipment Can Be Financed?

Unlike general business loans, equipment financing is specific to the asset. We cover a wide range of industrial machinery.

### Precision Machining (CNC)
*   **CNC Turning Centers (Lathes):** Mazak, Okuma, Haas.
*   **Vertical Machining Centers (VMC):** Fanuc, Brother, DMG Mori.
*   **5-Axis Machines:** For aerospace and medical components.

### Plastic & Rubber
*   **Injection Molding Machines:** Haitian, Nissei, Engel. (From 50-ton to 1,000-ton clamping force).
*   **Blow Molding Machines:** For bottle production.
*   **Extruders:** For pipes and profiles.

### Packaging & Processing
*   **Automatic Filling Lines:** Bottle/Can filling.
*   **Labeling Machines:** High-speed applicators.
*   **Food Processing Equipment:** Ovens, mixers, conveyors.

### Supporting Equipment
*   **Air Compressors:** Atlas Copco, Kaeser. (Vital for pneumatic tools).
*   **Generators:** Cummins, Perkins. (Backup power).
*   **Laser Cutting Machines:** Trumpf, Amada, Bystronic.

## 2. ROI Analysis: Manual vs. Automated Production

Is the monthly installment worth it? Let's analyze a real scenario.

**Case:** Small metal fabrication shop making brackets.
**Current Process:** 3 Manual Lathes + 3 Operators.
**Proposed:** 1 CNC Turning Center + 1 Operator.

| Metric | Manual Process (Current) | Automated Process (CNC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Output / Month** | 1,000 Units | **3,000 Units** |
| **Labor Cost** | RM 6,000 (3 Workers) | **RM 2,500 (1 Skilled Worker)** |
| **Defect Rate** | 5% (50 Rejects) | **0.5% (15 Rejects)** |
| **Material Wastage** | RM 500 | **RM 150** |
| **Monthly Installment** | RM 0 (Old Machines) | **RM 4,500 (New CNC)** |
| **NET PROFIT INCREASE** | Baseline | **+ RM 15,000 / Month** |

**Conclusion:** Even after paying the loan (RM 4,500), the company earns an extra RM 10,500 in pure profit due to tripled output and reduced labor.

## 3. Financing Options for Manufacturing SMEs

### Option A: Industrial Hire Purchase (IHP)
*   **Structure:** Bank buys the machine, you hire it. You own it at the end.
*   **Interest:** 3.5% - 5.5% Flat p.a.
*   **Tenure:** 3 - 5 Years.
*   **Best For:** Most SMEs buying standard machinery.

### Option B: Leasing (Operating Lease)
*   **Structure:** Rent the machine for 3-5 years. Return it or buy at residual value.
*   **Benefit:** Off-balance sheet financing. Tax deductible rental.
*   **Best For:** High-tech equipment that becomes obsolete quickly (e.g., 3D Printers).

### Option C: Government Soft Loans (MIDF / SME Bank)
*   **Benefit:** Low interest (2% - 4% p.a.).
*   **Drawback:** Slow approval (3-6 months). Strict compliance.

## 4. How to Finance Used Industrial Machinery

"Can I finance a 15-year-old Haitian Injection Molding Machine?"
**Yes, with Ing Heng Credit.**

Banks often reject machinery > 7 years old because valuing them is hard.
We understand the secondary market.
*   **Condition:** Must be in working order.
*   **Valuation:** Based on current market resale value, not book value.
*   **Tenure:** Usually shorter (2-3 years) for older machines.

**Why Buy Used?**
A used 200-ton Haitian might cost RM 80,000 compared to RM 250,000 new. For a startup factory, this lower entry cost is crucial.

## 5. The Application Process for Factory Owners

When applying, focus on the **Contract** or **Purchase Order (PO)**.

1.  **Select Machine:** Get quotation from supplier.
2.  **Prove Demand:** Show us the PO from your client (e.g., "Client X orders 50,000 bottles/month").
3.  **Submit Financials:** 6 months bank statements showing healthy turnover.
4.  **Site Visit:** We visit your factory to see existing operations.
5.  **Approval:** We issue the LO.

**Tip:** If you are a subcontractor for a big MNC (e.g., Dyson, Proton), show the vendor registration letter. It boosts your credit score instantly.

## 6. Automation Capital Allowance (ACA)

Don't forget tax benefits!
The Malaysian government grants **200% Capital Allowance** on the first RM 4 million spent on automation machinery.
*   This effectively reduces your taxable income significantly.
*   Ask your tax consultant about "Automation CA" when you buy.

## Conclusion

Manufacturing is a capital-intensive game. The winners are those who leverage finance to deploy the best technology. Don't let your competitors out-produce you because they have better machines.

**Upgrade your production line today.**
From a single CNC lathe to a full robotic assembly line, we have the funding expertise to support your industrial growth.
