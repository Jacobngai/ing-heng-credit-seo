## Executive Summary: Rent or Own?

**The Dilemma:**
Should you rent a forklift for RM 2,500/month or buy it for RM 100,000?

**The Short Answer:**
*   **Leasing/Rental:** Good for short-term projects (< 2 years) or if you want zero maintenance headaches.
*   **Buying (Financing):** Much cheaper for long-term use (3+ years). You own the asset at the end.

**Key Insight:**
With **0% Deposit Financing** now available, the monthly cost of buying is often **similar** to renting. But after 5 years, you own a RM 30,000 asset instead of nothing.

**Verdict:** If you plan to use the forklift for more than 3 years, buying is the financially superior choice.

## 1. Understanding the Two Models

### Option A: Forklift Leasing (Rental)
*   **Structure:** You pay a monthly fee to use the machine. The lessor (rental company) owns it.
*   **Includes:** Maintenance, repairs, replacement unit if breakdown.
*   **Term:** Usually 1 - 3 years renewable.

### Option B: Forklift Buying (Hire Purchase)
*   **Structure:** You take a loan to buy the machine. You own it after the final payment.
*   **Includes:** Machine only. You pay for maintenance separately.
*   **Term:** 3 - 5 years.

## 2. The Financial Comparison (5 Years)

Let's compare the cost of a **2.5 Ton Diesel Forklift (Toyota 8FD25)**.
*   **Market Price:** RM 100,000.
*   **Rental Rate:** RM 2,200 / month.

| Cost Item | Option A: Leasing (5 Years) | Option B: Buying (0% Deposit Loan) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upfront Payment** | RM 6,600 (3 Months Deposit) | **RM 0 (Zero Down)** |
| **Monthly Payment** | RM 2,200 (Rental) | **RM 2,050 (Loan Installment)** |
| **Maintenance Cost** | RM 0 (Included) | **RM 300 / Month (Est.)** |
| **Total Monthly Cashflow** | **RM 2,200** | **RM 2,350** |
| **Total Paid over 5 Years** | RM 132,000 | **RM 141,000** |
| **Asset Value at Year 5** | **RM 0 (Return Machine)** | **RM 35,000 (You Own It)** |
| **NET COST (Total - Asset)** | **RM 132,000** | **RM 106,000** |

**The Result:**
Buying saves you **RM 26,000** over 5 years.
AND... in Year 6, 7, and 8, the buying cost is **ZERO** (loan finished), while rental cost continues at RM 26,400 per year.

## 3. Tax Benefits: The Hidden Advantage of Buying

Many business owners forget tax.
*   **Rental:** 100% Tax Deductible as expense.
*   **Buying:** You claim **Capital Allowances (Initial 20% + Annual 20%)**.
    *   This means you can write off the entire RM 100,000 cost against your taxable profit within 4 years.
    *   Plus, the interest portion of the loan is tax-deductible.

**Conclusion:** Both offer tax shields, but Capital Allowances (Buying) can be accelerated, offering a huge tax break in Year 1.

## 4. When Leasing Makes Sense (The Exception)

Don't buy if:
1.  **Short Project:** You only need the forklift for a 6-month contract.
2.  **Uncertain Usage:** You don't know if you'll need 2 tons or 3 tons next year.
3.  **High Maintenance Environment:** Corrosive chemical factory or 24/7 usage (3 shifts). The maintenance cost might exceed the rental premium.
4.  **Off-Balance Sheet:** You want to keep debt ratios low for other banking reasons.

## 5. 0% Down Payment: The Game Changer

In the past, buying required a RM 20,000 (20%) deposit. That was a huge barrier.
Now, Ing Heng Credit offers **0% Down Payment** for qualified SMEs.
*   **Impact:** You can switch from renting to owning without taking any cash out of your pocket.
*   **Cash Flow:** Your monthly outflow changes from "Rental Expense" to "Loan Repayment" (often similar amount).

## 6. Maintenance: The Fear Factor

"If I buy, what if it breaks down?"
*   **Reality:** Modern Japanese forklifts (Toyota, Mitsubishi) are incredibly reliable.
*   **Cost:** A basic service (oil, filters) costs RM 300 - RM 500 every 3 months.
*   **Solution:** You can sign a "Preventive Maintenance Contract" with a service provider for RM 150/month to handle the headache, just like a rental.

## Conclusion

Stop paying your landlord's mortgage. Stop paying your rental company's asset cost.
If your business is stable and plans to operate for 5+ years, buying your forklift fleet is the only logical financial decision.
