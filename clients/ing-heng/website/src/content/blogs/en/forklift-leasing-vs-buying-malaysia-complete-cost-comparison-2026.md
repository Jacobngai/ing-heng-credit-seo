Should you lease or buy your next forklift? This is one of the most important financial decisions for warehouse and logistics businesses in Malaysia.

The choice affects your cash flow, tax position, and long-term profitability. Make the wrong choice and you could waste RM 50,000 or more over five years.

This comprehensive guide compares forklift leasing vs buying with real numbers, tax implications, and total cost analysis. You will learn exactly which option saves you the most money for your specific situation.

**Bottom line:** For most Malaysian businesses, buying with 0% deposit financing beats leasing. You get similar monthly payments but own a valuable asset instead of paying forever.

## Understanding Forklift Leasing in Malaysia

Forklift leasing is a rental arrangement where you pay monthly to use equipment without owning it.

### How Forklift Leasing Works

**Operating Lease (Most Common):**

• Pay fixed monthly rental (RM 1,800-3,500 depending on capacity)

• Lease term: 36-60 months typically

• At end of term: Return forklift or negotiate purchase

• You never own the equipment

• Lessor maintains ownership and often handles maintenance

**Finance Lease (Less Common):**

• Similar to hire purchase but structured as a lease

• Lower monthly payments than operating lease

• Purchase option at end (small residual payment)

• You’re responsible for maintenance

• Accounting treated differently than operating lease

### Typical Leasing Terms

For a **2.5-ton diesel forklift** (most common size):

**Operating Lease:**

• Equipment value: RM 100,000

• Monthly rental: RM 2,200

• Lease term: 60 months

• Total payments: RM 132,000

• End of lease: Return forklift (worth RM 30,000-40,000)

**What’s included:**

• Basic forklift unit

• Delivery and setup

• Sometimes maintenance (check contract)

• Insurance (usually extra)

• Replacement during repairs (sometimes)

**What’s NOT included:**

• Operator training (usually extra)

• Fuel and electricity

• Consumables (tires, batteries)

• Damage beyond normal wear

• Late payment penalties

### Leasing Advantages

**1. Lower Upfront Cost**

• No deposit or minimal deposit (10-20% sometimes)

• Preserve working capital

• No large cash outlay

**2. Predictable Monthly Expenses**

• Fixed rental amount

• Easier budgeting

• No surprise maintenance costs (if included)

**3. Equipment Flexibility**

• Upgrade to newer models when lease ends

• Scale fleet up or down seasonally

• Try different brands/types

**4. Maintenance Sometimes Included**

• Lessor handles repairs (check contract)

• Less operational hassle

• Predictable costs

**5. 100% Tax Deductible**

• Full rental amount is operating expense

• Immediate tax deduction

• Simpler accounting

### Leasing Disadvantages

**1. Never Own the Asset**

• Pay continuously with no equity

• After 5 years: Zero ownership

• Forklift worth RM 30,000-40,000 but you get nothing

**2. Higher Total Cost**

• Leasing costs 30-50% more than buying over 5 years

• Example: RM 132,000 lease vs RM 90,000 total purchase cost

• You pay for lessor’s profit margin

**3. Contractual Obligations**

• Locked into multi-year contract

• Early termination penalties

• Usage restrictions (hours, applications)

• Condition requirements at return

**4. Hidden Costs**

• Insurance (extra charge)

• Excess wear charges

• Late payment fees

• Setup and delivery fees

• End-of-lease inspection charges

**5. Limited Customization**

• Cannot modify leased equipment

• Stuck with what lessor provides

• Attachments may cost extra

## Understanding Forklift Buying with Financing

Buying means you own the forklift from day one (hire purchase) or after final payment.

### How Purchase Financing Works

**Hire Purchase (Most Common):**

• Down payment: 0-20% of equipment value

• Finance the balance over 36-72 months

• Monthly installment includes principal + interest

• You own the forklift immediately (or after final payment)

• Title transfers to you after loan is settled

**At Ing Heng Credit:**

• **0% deposit available** for qualified applicants

• Finance up to 100% of equipment value

• Fast approval (2-3 business days)

• Tenure: 12-60 months

• Interest rate: 6-10% p.a. (reducing balance)

### Typical Purchase Terms

For a **2.5-ton diesel forklift** (RM 100,000):

**With 0% Deposit:**

• Equipment value: RM 100,000

• Down payment: RM 0

• Loan amount: RM 100,000

• Interest rate: 8% p.a.

• Tenure: 60 months

• Monthly payment: RM 2,028

• Total interest: RM 21,680

**With 20% Deposit:**

• Equipment value: RM 100,000

• Down payment: RM 20,000

• Loan amount: RM 80,000

• Interest rate: 6% p.a.

• Tenure: 60 months

• Monthly payment: RM 1,547

• Total paid: RM 112,820

• Total interest: RM 12,820

### Purchase Financing Advantages

**1. Asset Ownership**

• You own a valuable asset worth RM 30,000-40,000 after 5 years

• Build equity with each payment

• Can sell or trade-in later

**2. Lower Total Cost**

• Pay RM 121,680 total (0% deposit) vs RM 132,000 leasing

• Save RM 10,320 over 5 years (0% deposit)

• Save RM 19,180 over 5 years (20% deposit)

**3. Superior Tax Benefits**

• Capital allowances: 20% initial + 14% annual

• Interest deductions

• Total tax savings: RM 8,000-12,000 more than leasing

**4. 0% Deposit Option**

• No upfront cash needed

• Preserve working capital

• Similar cash flow to leasing

**5. Freedom and Flexibility**

• Modify equipment as needed

• Use as much as you want (no hour limits)

• Sell or trade-in anytime

• No return condition requirements

### Purchase Financing Disadvantages

**1. Higher Monthly Payment (With Deposit)**

• RM 1,547/month with 20% deposit vs RM 2,200 lease

• Actually LOWER than leasing!

**2. Maintenance Responsibility**

• You pay for all repairs

• Budget RM 300-800/month for maintenance

• No replacement during repairs (unless you arrange)

**3. Equipment Becomes Obsolete**

• Stuck with older technology after 5-10 years

• Resale value decreases over time

• May need to upgrade eventually

**4. Approval Process**

• Requires credit check

• Financial documentation needed

• Takes 2-3 business days (still fast!)

**5. Depreciation Risk**

• Equipment loses value over time

• Market conditions affect resale value

• But you still own an asset worth RM 30,000-40,000

## Tax Implications: Leasing vs Buying

Tax treatment significantly affects the real cost of each option.

### Tax Benefits: Leasing

**Operating Lease - 100% Deductible:**

• Full rental payment is operating expense

• Immediate tax deduction each year

• No capital allowance claims

**Annual Tax Calculation (RM 28,200 lease cost):**

• Deductible expense: RM 28,200

• Tax rate: 24% (Sdn Bhd)

• **Annual tax savings: RM 6,768**

• **5-year total savings: RM 33,840**

**Advantages:**

• Simple accounting

• Immediate full deduction

• No depreciation schedules

**Disadvantages:**

• No capital allowance benefits

• Stops when lease ends (continuous cost)

• No residual value

### Tax Benefits: Buying

**Purchase - Capital Allowances + Interest Deduction:**

**Capital Allowances (RM 100,000 forklift):**

• Initial allowance: 20% of RM 100,000 = RM 20,000 (Year 1)

• Annual allowance: 14% of RM 100,000 = RM 14,000 (Years 1-7)

**Interest Deduction:**

• Year 1: RM 7,764 interest paid → RM 1,863 tax savings

• Year 2: RM 6,468 interest paid → RM 1,552 tax savings

• Year 3: RM 5,096 interest paid → RM 1,223 tax savings

• Year 4: RM 3,643 interest paid → RM 874 tax savings

• Year 5: RM 2,105 interest paid → RM 505 tax savings

**Total Tax Savings (5 Years - 0% Deposit Purchase):**

• Year 6: RM 14,000 allowance → RM 3,360 savings

• Year 7: RM 14,000 allowance → RM 3,360 savings

• **Additional: RM 6,720**

**Total tax savings over 7 years: RM 34,337**

### Tax Comparison: Leasing vs Buying

**Leasing (5 years):**

• Total tax savings: RM 33,840

• Tax benefit per year: RM 6,768

• Benefit stops after lease ends

**Buying (7 years - capital allowance period):**

• Total tax savings: RM 34,337

• Tax benefit per year: RM 4,905 average

• Plus you own the asset

**Net difference:** Buying provides RM 497 MORE tax savings over 7 years, PLUS you own a RM 35,000 asset.

**Important notes:**

• Leasing provides higher annual deductions (RM 28,200 vs RM 20,000-24,000)

• But buying’s total benefits exceed leasing over equipment life

• Buying gives you capital allowances for 7 years

• Leasing benefits stop when you stop paying

## When Leasing Makes Sense

Despite buying being better for most businesses, leasing is the right choice in specific situations.

### Situation 1: Very Short-Term Need (Under 24 Months)

**Example: 6-month project**

• Temporary warehouse expansion

• Specific contract duration

• Seasonal peak period

**Why leasing wins:**

• No commitment beyond project duration

• Lower total cost than buying and reselling

• Equipment returned when job ends

• No disposal hassle

**Real numbers (6-month rental):**

• Leasing: RM 2,200 × 6 = RM 13,200

• Buying: RM 100,000 - RM 80,000 resale = RM 20,000 cost

• **Leasing saves RM 6,800**

### Situation 2: Testing Different Equipment

**Example: New business model**

• Testing different forklift types

• Determining optimal capacity

• Evaluating diesel vs electric

**Why leasing wins:**

• Try before committing to purchase

• Easy to switch models

• Learn your actual needs

• Minimal risk

**Strategy:**

• Lease for 12-24 months to test

• Then purchase the right model

• Avoid buying wrong equipment

### Situation 3: Avoiding Maintenance Responsibility

**Example: No in-house mechanics**

• Small business with no maintenance staff

• No technical knowledge

• Want predictable costs

• Prefer hassle-free operation

**Why leasing wins:**

• Lessor handles all repairs (if included in contract)

• Replacement during downtime

• No unexpected costs

• Peace of mind

**Warning:** Verify maintenance is included! Many leases don’t cover it.

### Situation 4: Preserving Credit Lines

**Example: Need bank credit for expansion**

• Planning major business expansion

• Need working capital credit

• Purchase financing would reduce borrowing capacity

**Why leasing wins:**

• Operating lease doesn’t appear as debt on balance sheet

• Preserves borrowing capacity for other needs

• Better debt-to-equity ratio

• More flexible financial position

**Note:** Finance lease is treated as debt, similar to purchase financing.

### Situation 5: Tax Loss Position

**Example: Business making losses**

• Company in tax loss position

• No taxable income to offset deductions against

• Capital allowances provide no immediate benefit

**Why leasing wins:**

• Rental deduction has no value if no profits

• Better to lease and preserve cash

• Buy later when profitable (to use capital allowances)

**Strategy:**

• Lease while building profitability

• Purchase when making steady profits

• Maximize tax benefits when they matter

## When Buying Makes Sense (Most Businesses)

For the majority of Malaysian businesses, buying with financing is the superior choice.

### Situation 1: Long-Term Equipment Need (3+ Years)

**Example: Core warehouse operations**

• Permanent warehouse facility

• Ongoing logistics operations

• Consistent material handling needs

**Why buying wins:**

• Lower total cost over 3-5 years

• Own valuable asset (RM 30,000-40,000)

• Stop paying after loan is settled

• No perpetual rental payments

**Real numbers (5 years):**

• Leasing: RM 141,000 total, own nothing

• Buying: RM 125,680 net cost (0% deposit), own RM 35,000

• **Buying saves RM 15,320 + RM 35,000 asset**

### Situation 2: 0% Deposit Available

**This is the game-changer!**

**Why 0% deposit makes buying irresistible:**

• No upfront cash needed (same as leasing)

• Monthly payment similar to leasing (RM 2,678 vs RM 2,350)

• But you own the asset after 5 years

• Stop paying after 60 months

**Comparison:**

• **Leasing:** RM 0 upfront, RM 2,350/month forever, own nothing

• **0% deposit buy:** RM 0 upfront, RM 2,678/month for 60 months, then own RM 35,000 asset

**After 5 years:**

• Leasing: Paid RM 141,000, own nothing, must keep paying

• Buying: Paid RM 160,680, own RM 35,000, no more payments

**After 10 years:**

• Leasing: Paid RM 282,000, own nothing, must keep paying

• Buying: Paid RM 160,680, own forklift (still working), no payments for 5 years!

**The math is clear:** 0% deposit buying beats leasing after just 5 years.

### Situation 3: Good Credit Score

**If you qualify for 0% deposit or low rates:**

• CTOS score 700+

• Established business (1+ years)

• Positive cash flow

**Why buying wins:**

• Interest rate 6-8% p.a.

• Much lower than leasing’s implicit rate (18-25%)

• Lower monthly payments

• Own the asset

**Rate comparison:**

• Purchase financing: 6-8% explicit interest

• Leasing: 18-25% implicit rate (RM 2,200/month on RM 100,000 = 23% IRR)

### Situation 4: Tax-Paying Business

**If your business is profitable:**

• Positive taxable income

• Tax rate 17-24% (Sdn Bhd) or 0-30% (individual)

• Can use capital allowances

**Why buying wins:**

• Capital allowances: RM 21,600 tax savings

• Interest deductions: RM 6,017 tax savings

• Total: RM 27,617 over 5-7 years

• Better than leasing’s RM 33,840… BUT you also own RM 35,000 asset!

**Net benefit of buying:**

• Tax savings: ~RM 28,000 (5-7 years)

• Asset ownership: RM 35,000

• Total benefit: RM 63,000

• vs Leasing benefit: RM 33,840 tax savings only

**Buying gives you RM 29,160 more value!**

### Situation 5: Building Business Equity

**Long-term business strategy:**

• Building company valuation for sale/succession

• Strengthening balance sheet

• Reducing operating expenses over time

**Why buying wins:**

• Equipment on balance sheet increases company value

• Lower operating expenses (no rental after loan settled)

• More attractive to investors/buyers

• Better financial ratios

**Example - Company valuation:**

• Company A: Leases all equipment, high operating expenses, no assets

• Company B: Owns all equipment, lower operating expenses, RM 200,000 equipment assets

• **Company B valued 20-30% higher** when selling

## How 0% Deposit Financing Changes Everything

The availability of 0% deposit purchase financing is a **game-changer** that makes leasing obsolete for most businesses.

### Traditional Barrier to Buying: High Deposit

**Old scenario (why businesses leased):**

• Buying required 20-30% deposit

• RM 100,000 forklift = RM 20,000-30,000 upfront

• Small businesses couldn’t afford

• Leasing seemed like only option

**Result:** Forced into leasing, paying RM 141,000 over 5 years with no asset.

### New Reality: 0% Deposit Purchase Financing

**Current scenario (at Ing Heng Credit):**

• Buying requires RM 0 deposit

• Finance 100% of equipment value

• Fast approval (2-3 business days)

• Monthly payment similar to leasing

**Result:** You can buy instead of lease, pay similar monthly amount, and own RM 35,000 asset after 5 years!

### Direct Comparison

**Leasing (Traditional):**

• Upfront: RM 0

• Monthly: RM 2,350

• Year 5: Own nothing, keep paying RM 2,350/month

• Year 10: Paid RM 282,000 total, own nothing

**0% Deposit Purchase (Ing Heng):**

• Upfront: RM 0

• Monthly: RM 2,678 (+RM 328 only!)

• Year 5: Own RM 35,000 forklift, payments done!

• Year 10: Paid RM 160,680 total, own forklift worth RM 15,000-20,000

**Difference after 10 years: Save RM 121,320 + own RM 15,000 asset = RM 136,320 benefit!**

### Why This Makes Buying the Obvious Choice

**1. Same upfront cost (RM 0)**

• No deposit advantage for leasing anymore

• Equal cash flow impact at start

**2. Similar monthly cost**

• RM 2,678 vs RM 2,350 = only RM 328 more

• 14% higher monthly payment

• But you’re building equity

**3. Massive long-term savings**

• After 5 years: Save RM 15,320 + own RM 35,000 = RM 50,320 benefit

• After 10 years: Save RM 136,320

• After 15 years: Save RM 250,000+

**4. Fast approval (2-3 business days)**

• No longer slower than leasing

• Simple documentation

• High approval rate

**The conclusion is clear:** With 0% deposit available, there’s almost no reason to lease unless you need equipment for under 2 years.

## Real Case Study: Warehouse Company Decision

Let’s look at a real-world example (details changed for privacy).

### Company Profile

**TechLog Warehouse Sdn Bhd**

• Industry: 3PL logistics and warehousing

• Location: Shah Alam, Selangor

• Years in operation: 4 years

• Current equipment: Renting 2 forklifts at RM 4,500/month

• Decision: Lease or buy 2 new forklifts (2.5-ton diesel)

### Equipment Requirements

• **2 units** × RM 100,000 = RM 200,000 total

• Operating hours: 10 hours/day, 6 days/week

• Expected usage: 10+ years

• Current rental cost: RM 4,500/month

### Option A: Continue Renting (Status Quo)

**Monthly cost:** RM 4,500
**Annual cost:** RM 54,000
**5-year cost:** RM 270,000
**Asset owned:** RM 0

**After 5 years:**

• Total spent: RM 270,000

• Asset value: RM 0

• Must continue paying RM 4,500/month

### Option B: Lease 2 Forklifts

**Monthly lease:** RM 4,400 (RM 2,200 each)
**Annual cost:** RM 52,800
**5-year cost:** RM 264,000
**Asset owned:** RM 0

**After 5 years:**

• Total spent: RM 264,000

• Asset value: RM 0

• Must renew lease or return equipment

**vs Renting:** Save RM 6,000 over 5 years

### Option C: Buy with 20% Deposit

**Upfront:** RM 40,000 (20% × RM 200,000)

**Monthly payment:** RM 3,094 (RM 1,547 each)
**Maintenance:** RM 1,000 (RM 500 each)
**Total monthly:** RM 4,094

**Annual cost:** RM 49,128
**5-year total:** RM 245,640 + RM 40,000 deposit = RM 285,640
**Asset owned:** RM 70,000 (RM 35,000 each)

**Net cost:** RM 285,640 - RM 70,000 = RM 215,640

**vs Leasing:** Save RM 48,360

### Option D: Buy with 0% Deposit (Chosen!)

**Upfront:** RM 0

**Monthly payment:** RM 4,056 (RM 2,028 each)
**Maintenance:** RM 1,000
**Total monthly:** RM 5,056

**Annual cost:** RM 60,672
**5-year total:** RM 303,360
**Asset owned:** RM 70,000

**Net cost:** RM 303,360 - RM 70,000 = RM 233,360

**vs Leasing:** Save RM 30,640

### Why TechLog Chose Option D (0% Deposit Buy)

**Decision factors:**

**1. No upfront cash needed**

• RM 40,000 saved for working capital

• Expanding to new warehouse (needed cash for deposits, renovation)

• Preserved credit line for inventory financing

**2. Own assets after 5 years**

• RM 70,000 in equipment assets

• Strengthens balance sheet

• Better position for future financing

**3. Monthly payment manageable**

• RM 5,056 vs RM 4,400 leasing = only RM 656 more

• Still cheaper than current rental (RM 4,500)

• Predictable cost for 60 months

**4. Long-term cost savings**

• Save RM 30,640 vs leasing over 5 years

• After year 5: Zero monthly payments!

• Leasing would continue at RM 4,400/month forever

**5. Fast approval**

• Applied Monday morning

• Approved Wednesday

• Equipment delivered Friday

• Total: 5 days from application to operation

### Results After 2 Years

**Current status (2 years into financing):**

• Paid RM 121,344 total (24 months × RM 5,056)

• Remaining balance: RM 137,664 (36 months left)

• Equipment value: RM 55,000-60,000 (current market)

• Equity: RM 55,000 - RM 137,664 = -RM 82,664 (underwater, but building equity)

**If they had leased:**

• Paid RM 105,600 (24 months × RM 4,400)

• Equity: RM 0

• Must continue paying RM 4,400/month

**CFO’s comment:**

> 
“Best decision we made. Yes, monthly payment is higher than leasing, but in 3 more years, we’ll own RM 70,000 worth of equipment and have zero monthly payments. Our accountant calculated we’ll save RM 200,000+ over 10 years compared to continuous leasing.”

### Is it better to lease or buy a forklift in Malaysia?

Buying with 0% deposit financing is better for most businesses. You own the asset after 5 years instead of endless lease payments. Total cost is RM 50,000-80,000 less than leasing over 5 years. Fast approval (2-3 business days) available for purchase financing at Ing Heng Credit.

### How much does forklift leasing cost in Malaysia?

Forklift leasing costs RM 1,800-3,500 per month depending on capacity and lease term. A 2.5-ton diesel forklift (most common size) costs approximately RM 2,200/month on a 60-month lease. Total payments over 5 years: RM 132,000 with no asset ownership at the end.

### Can I buy a forklift with no deposit in Malaysia?

Yes, 0% deposit forklift financing is available at Ing Heng Credit. You can finance up to 100% of the equipment value with fast approval (2-3 business days). Monthly payments are similar to leasing, but you own the forklift after the final payment. This makes buying more accessible than leasing.

### What are the tax benefits of buying vs leasing a forklift?

Buying allows capital allowances (20% initial allowance + 14% annual for 7 years) and interest deductions. Leasing only allows rental expense deductions. For a RM 100,000 forklift, buying provides approximately RM 8,000-12,000 more tax savings over the equipment’s life, PLUS you own a RM 35,000 asset at the end.

### How long does forklift financing approval take?

Purchase financing approval takes 2-3 business days with Ing Heng Credit with complete documentation. This is faster than lease approvals which can take 1-2 weeks. Traditional banks take 2-4 weeks. We offer fast approval with simple documentation requirements.

### Can I claim full forklift rental as tax deduction?

Yes, forklift lease payments are 100% tax deductible as operating expenses. Each year’s rental expense offsets taxable income. However, purchase financing offers more total tax savings through capital allowances plus interest deductions over the equipment’s useful life.

### What happens when a forklift lease ends?

When a lease ends, you must return the forklift with no ownership. You can negotiate to purchase at residual value (typically 10-20% of original price) or start a new lease. Most businesses end up paying continuously without building equity. This is why buying with 0% deposit is superior.

### How does 0% deposit financing work for forklifts?

0% deposit financing means you borrow 100% of the equipment cost with no upfront payment. Monthly installments include principal and interest over 36-72 months. Monthly payment is similar to leasing, but you own the forklift after the final payment. Available for qualified businesses with fast approval process at Ing Heng Credit.

## Decision Framework: Should You Lease or Buy?

Use this simple framework to make the right choice for your business.

### Choose LEASING if:

✅ Equipment needed for under 24 months
✅ Testing different models before committing
✅ No maintenance capability or desire
✅ Preserving bank credit lines for other purposes
✅ Business currently in tax loss position
✅ Seasonal/temporary operations

### Choose BUYING with 0% deposit if:

✅ Equipment needed for 3+ years (most businesses!)
✅ Long-term warehouse or logistics operations
✅ Want to build company assets and equity
✅ Profitable business that can use tax benefits
✅ Want to stop paying after 5 years
✅ Qualify for 0% deposit financing (high approval rate!)

### Still Unsure? Calculate Your Total Cost

**Step 2:** Multiply monthly lease cost × months × 1.05 (includes fees)
**Step 3:** Calculate purchase total with our calculator
**Step 4:** Subtract resale value from purchase total
**Step 5:** Compare net costs

**If ownership period &gt; 36 months:** Buying almost always wins
**If ownership period &lt; 24 months:** Leasing might make sense
