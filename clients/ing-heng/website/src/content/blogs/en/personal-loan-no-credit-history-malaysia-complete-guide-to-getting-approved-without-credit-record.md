Starting your financial journey without credit history doesn’t mean getting locked out of funding opportunities. Here’s the reality:

**The No Credit History Challenge:**

• Banks automatically reject applications without CCRIS scores

• Traditional lenders want 2+ years of credit track record

• “Catch-22” situation: Need credit to get credit

• First-time borrowers face limited options

**Our No Credit History Solution:**

• Income-based assessment instead of credit score dependency

• Employment stability evaluation over credit requirements

• Alternative documentation acceptance for approval

• First-time borrower specialist programs

**The 0% Deposit Advantage:**
Personal loans require no collateral or deposit. Your income and employment become your qualification foundation, not your credit history.

**Sarah’s First Loan Success Story:**
Sarah, 24, just started working as an accountant. No credit cards, no previous loans, no CCRIS record.

**Traditional Bank Response:**

• “Come back after 2 years with credit cards”

• “We need credit history to assess risk”

• “Apply for credit card first, then personal loan”

**Our Approval Process:**

• Evaluated her CPA qualification and job stability

• Reviewed 6 months of salary payments

• Assessed her company’s reputation and growth

• **Result:** RM 25,000 approved at 9.5% interest

**Sarah’s Transformation:**

• **Immediate Access:** Funded emergency needs immediately

• **Credit Building:** Established first credit record

• **Financial Growth:** Built foundation for future credit

• **Confidence Boost:** Financial independence achieved

When you walk into a bank for your first personal loan and they ask for your credit history, and you have to explain you’ve never borrowed before, does that feeling of being judged make your face flush with embarrassment?

When you’re told to “build credit first” but every credit application gets rejected for having no history, does that circular logic make you feel trapped and frustrated?

## Understanding the No Credit History Landscape

Why traditional lenders struggle with first-time borrowers:

### Traditional Banking Credit Assessment

**Standard Bank Requirements:**

• CCRIS score 600+ (you have none)

• 24+ months credit history (you have zero)

• Multiple credit products (cards, loans, hire purchase)

• Payment track record demonstration

• Credit utilization patterns analysis

**Why Banks Reject No Credit History:**

• **Risk Models:** Built around existing credit behavior

• **Automated Systems:** Cannot process blank credit profiles

• **Conservative Approach:** Prefer proven payment patterns

• **Regulatory Requirements:** Internal scoring minimums

**The Credit Score Paradox:**

Need Credit Score → To Get Credit → To Build Credit Score
     ↑                                            ↓
Without Credit History ← Cannot Get Approved ← Banks Require History
### Alternative Assessment Methods We Use

### Income Level Assessment

**Minimum Income Requirements:**

• **Experienced Workers:** RM 2,500 monthly (non-degree)

• **Government Employees:** RM 1,800 monthly (special program)

**Loan Amount Calculations:**

Monthly Income × Multiplier = Maximum Loan Amount

Examples:
RM 3,000 × 8 = RM 24,000 (conservative)
RM 4,000 × 10 = RM 40,000 (standard)
RM 5,000 × 12 = RM 60,000 (high income)
### Debt Service Ratio Without Credit History

**DSR Calculation for New Borrowers:**

Proposed Monthly Payment ÷ Monthly Income = DSR

Target DSR: 30-40% (conservative for first-time borrowers)
**Example DSR Calculation:**

Monthly Income: RM 4,000
Maximum DSR: 35%
Maximum Monthly Payment: RM 4,000 × 35% = RM 1,400
**DSR Advantages for New Borrowers:**

• **Clean Slate:** No existing debt obligations

• **Lower DSR:** More borrowing capacity available

• **Conservative Approach:** Lower risk profile

• **Growth Potential:** Income likely to increase
