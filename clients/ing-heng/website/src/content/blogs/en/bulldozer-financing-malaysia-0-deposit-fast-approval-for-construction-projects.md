Need a bulldozer for your construction or land clearing project? Getting financing should not slow you down. At Ing Heng Credit, we offer bulldozer financing with zero deposit required and loans up to 100% of equipment value.

Whether you need a mini dozer for residential projects or a large crawler for mining operations, we help Malaysian contractors and developers access the heavy equipment they need to grow.

**Why contractors choose us for bulldozer financing:**

• 0% deposit required for qualified applicants

• Finance up to 100% of bulldozer value

• Fast approval compared to banks (we respond much quicker)

• High approval rate for qualified contractors

• Used dozers accepted (up to 10 years old)

• Competitive rates from 6.5% per annum

• New businesses accepted (1 year old minimum)

**40 years financing heavy equipment for Malaysian contractors.**

## Why Finance a Bulldozer Instead of Renting?

### 1. Stop Paying Rental Fees Forever

**Rental costs add up fast:**

• Small dozer (D3): RM 3,000-5,000/month

• Medium dozer (D5): RM 8,000-12,000/month

• Large dozer (D7): RM 15,000-20,000/month

**Example: 5-ton dozer rental**

• Monthly rental: RM 10,000

• 3-year project: RM 360,000

• **Result:** RM 360,000 spent, zero assets owned

**Instead, finance with 0% deposit:**

• Dozer price: RM 400,000

• Finance 100%: RM 400,000 loan

• Monthly payment (60 months, 7% p.a.): RM 7,920

• **After 5 years:** Own RM 400,000 dozer, save RM 115,000

### 2. Own the Asset from Day One

When you finance a bulldozer:

• Build company assets

• Depreciation benefits for tax

• Use dozer for any project (not just one)

• Sell or trade-in when upgrading

• No daily rental charges eating profits

### 3. Win More Contracts

Many government and large-scale projects require:

• Proof of owned equipment (not rental)

• Financial stability (assets on balance sheet)

• Long-term capability (not dependent on rental availability)

**Owning your bulldozer makes you more competitive** for major contracts.

### 4. Better Cash Flow Management

Spread the cost over 36-60 months:

• Manage seasonal income fluctuations

• Align payments with project revenue

• Preserve working capital for operations

• Pay from profits, not reserves
