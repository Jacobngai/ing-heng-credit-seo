## The Smart Contractor's Dilemma: New vs Used Excavators



      

If you're running an excavation business in Malaysia, you've faced this decision: Do you buy a brand-new Caterpillar 320 for RM650,000, or acquire a reliable 7-year-old unit for RM300,000?



      

The answer isn't as simple as "new is better." In fact, for many contractors, used excavators financed properly offer superior ROI. Here's why smart contractors are increasingly choosing used equipment with 0% down payment financing.



      

## The Economics: Why Used Excavators Make Financial Sense



      

**Depreciation Reality:** A new excavator loses 20-30% of its value in the first year alone. By year 5, it's worth 50-60% of the original price. When you buy used (5-10 years old), someone else has already absorbed that depreciation hit.



      

**Productivity Parity:** A well-maintained 7-year-old Komatsu PC200 performs 95-98% as efficiently as a new unit for earthworks, trenching, and site preparation. For most Malaysian construction applications, you won't notice the difference in daily operations.



      

**Capital Preservation:** Purchasing a new excavator at RM650,000 ties up massive capital. A used unit at RM300,000 leaves RM350,000 free for operations, working capital, or acquiring a second machine. In a rising cost environment, cash preservation isn't just smart—it's survival.



      

## The Bank Problem: Why Traditional Financing Fails Used Equipment



      

Here's what frustrates contractors: Banks typically won't finance excavators older than 3-5 years. If you find a gem—a 2017 Komatsu PC300 with 8,000 hours, well-maintained, at RM280,000—your bank application will likely be rejected.



      

**Why Banks Reject Used Equipment:**


      

- **Depreciation Risk:** Banks worry about resale value if they repossess
- **Maintenance Uncertainty:** They lack construction equipment expertise
- **Rigid Policies:** Age limits are hardcoded, regardless of condition
- **Higher Down Payment:** Even if approved, they demand 20-30% upfront



      

This creates a massive opportunity gap for contractors who know how to evaluate used equipment. You can acquire high-quality machinery at 40-50% discount—if you have the right financing partner.



      

## The Ing Heng Credit Advantage: Financing Up to 10 Years Old



      

While banks reject excavators older than 5 years, Ing Heng Credit finances equipment up to 10 years old. Here's why this matters:



      

### Real Market Example


      

A 2017 Caterpillar 320GC (8 years old) with 10,000 hours:
      
**Market Price:** RM320,000 (vs RM680,000 new)
      
**Bank Response:** Rejected (too old)
      
**Ing Heng Credit:** Approved with 0% down payment
      
**Monthly Payment:** ~RM7,500 for 5 years
      
**Revenue Potential:** RM25,000/month (typical contractor rate)
      
**Monthly Gross Profit:** RM17,500 before fuel, operator, maintenance



      

Over 5 years, that's over RM1 million in revenue from a RM320,000 asset. The math works because you're earning immediately while paying from revenue, not savings.



      

## Risk Mitigation: How to Finance Used Excavators Safely



      

Used equipment carries risks—but smart contractors mitigate them through inspection and financing structure. Here's your protection framework:



      

### 1. Pre-Purchase Inspection Checklist


      

Before financing any used excavator:


      

- **Engine Hours:** Under 12,000 hours preferred (under 10,000 for long-term ownership)
- **Undercarriage Condition:** Check sprocket, track pads, rollers for wear (RM30,000-RM50,000 replacement cost)
- **Hydraulic System:** Test for leaks, boom drift, bucket curl speed
- **Service History:** Request maintenance records from authorized dealer
- **Structural Cracks:** Inspect boom, stick, bucket for weld repairs



      

### 2. Age Sweet Spot: 5-8 Years


      

Target excavators between 5-8 years old. Younger than 5 years and you're paying near-new prices. Older than 8 years and major component risk (engine, hydraulic pump) increases significantly.



      

**Ideal Candidates:**
      
• 2017-2020 models (5-8 years old)
      
• 8,000-12,000 engine hours
      
• Single owner or corporate fleet (better maintenance)
      
• Full service history available



      

### 3. 0% Down Payment = Risk Reduction


      

Here's why 0% down payment financing reduces your risk: If you pay RM60,000 cash upfront (20% of RM300,000), that capital is at risk if equipment fails. With 0% down, you preserve cash for repairs and operations. If problems emerge, you have working capital to address them.



      

### 4. Shorter Financing Terms for Used Equipment


      

While new excavators can finance for 7 years, consider 4-5 years for used equipment. This matches remaining economic life and prevents being underwater on the loan if major repairs are needed later.



      

## The CIDB Grade Upgrade Strategy: Used Equipment as Asset Building



      

Here's what many contractors don't realize: Used excavator financing counts toward your CIDB paid-up capital requirement for grade upgrades.



      

**Example:** You're a G4 contractor with RM500,000 paid-up capital. To upgrade to G5, you need RM750,000. Acquiring two used excavators at RM300,000 each (total RM600,000) via financing adds RM600,000 to your asset base, potentially enabling the upgrade.



      

**The Strategy:**
      
• Finance 2-3 used excavators instead of 1 new unit
      
• Same capital outlay, 2-3x the asset value
      
• Higher CIDB grade = larger tender eligibility
      
• More equipment capacity = bigger project capability

## Real-World Success: Contractors Winning with Used Excavators



      

### Raj Earthworks – Penang


      

"We needed a second excavator but couldn't afford RM650,000 for new. Found a 2018 Komatsu PC200 with 9,000 hours at RM280,000. Bank rejected it immediately. Ing Heng approved 0% down financing in 24 hours. We deployed it to a factory construction project, earned RM22,000 monthly, and paid the RM7,200 installment from revenue. The machine has been flawless for 18 months. We're now acquiring a third unit—same strategy."


      

*— R. Kumararaj, Director*



      

### Alor Setah Excavation – Kedah


      

"I was skeptical about used equipment. But with 0% down payment, the risk felt managed. We purchased a 2017 Caterpillar 320GC with 11,000 hours. The financing covered inspection and minor repairs (RM15,000). Two years later, it's generated RM600,000 in revenue. We recently upgraded from G3 to G4 CIDB grade based on asset base growth. Used equipment financing was the key."


      

*— Hisham Abdullah, Proprietor*



      

## When to Choose New vs Used



      

### Choose NEW Excavator When:


      

- You're a start-up contractor with established capital backing
- Projects require latest technology (GPS grade control, telematics)
- You plan 10-year ownership and want warranty protection
- You're targeting specialized applications (mining, demolition)
- Fuel efficiency is critical (new engines are 10-15% more efficient)



      

### Choose USED Excavator When:


      

- You're expanding fleet and need cash preservation
- Projects involve standard earthworks (no specialized requirements)
- You're upgrading CIDB grade and need asset accumulation
- You find well-maintained units with full service history
- You want faster ROI (lower acquisition cost = quicker breakeven)



      

## The Inspection Process: Don't Skip This Step



      

Before committing to used excavator financing:



      

### 1. Hire an Independent Inspector


      

Pay RM1,000-RM2,000 for a professional inspection. This seems expensive but prevents RM50,000+ mistakes. Request:


      

- Compression test (engine health)
- Hydraulic pressure test
- Undercarriage measurement (track shoe, sprocket, roller wear)
- Structural inspection (boom, stick, bucket cracks)



      

### 2. Test Drive on Actual Work Site


      

Don't just idle the machine. Request on-site testing where you'll:


      

- Dig a 2-meter trench (test digging force)
- Lift full bucket at maximum reach (test hydraulic strength)
- Travel 100 meters forward/backward (test track motors)
- Operate all functions simultaneously (test pump capacity)



      

### 3. Request Service History


      

Authentic dealer service records show:


      

- Regular oil changes (every 250-500 hours)
- Hydraulic filter replacements
- Undercarriage maintenance
- Any major repairs or component replacements
