# Excavator Financing with Bad Credit Malaysia: 95% Approval Rate

You've worked hard to build your construction business. You know that owning an excavator—instead of renting one—could save you thousands and help you win more projects. But there's a problem: your credit history isn't perfect.

Maybe you had late payments during the 2020 pandemic. Maybe a business deal went wrong. Maybe you're just starting out and don't have much credit history at all.

**Here's the truth: You are not alone.** Most Malaysian contractors have faced credit challenges at some point. And more importantly, **bad credit does NOT mean you can't get excavator financing.**

At Ing Heng Credit & Leasing, we've helped hundreds of contractors with credit issues get the equipment they need. Our approval rate is 95%—including applicants with CCRIS records, CTOS flags, and past payment problems.

In this guide, you'll learn:
- Why banks reject bad credit (and why we don't)
- How credit companies evaluate applications differently
- What "bad credit" really means in Malaysia
- How to strengthen your application
- Real interest rates and terms you can expect
- How to apply and get approved

Let's help you get that excavator.

## Why Banks Reject Bad Credit Applications

Traditional banks have strict rules. They use automated systems that look at one thing: your credit score.

**Here's what banks do:**

1. **Check CCRIS/CTOS** - If score below 700, automatic rejection
2. **Count late payments** - Even 1-2 late payments = rejection
3. **Look at bankruptcy history** - Any record = instant no
4. **Require collateral** - Need property or fixed deposit
5. **Take 2-4 weeks** - Slow approval process

**Why banks are so strict:**
Banks lend depositors' money. They need to follow strict regulations set by Bank Negara Malaysia. They prefer low-risk customers who fit into neat boxes.

**The result:** 60-70% of SME applications get rejected by banks.

But here's the good news: **Credit companies work differently.**

---

## How Credit Companies Evaluate Bad Credit Differently

Credit companies like Ing Heng Credit use a **business-first approach**. We understand that past credit issues don't define your current ability to repay.

### What We Actually Look At

**1. Current Business Performance**
- Do you have active projects?
- Are you generating revenue?
- Can you show recent bank statements?

**2. Equipment as Collateral**
- The excavator itself is collateral
- We can repo the equipment if needed
- Lower risk for us = easier approval for you

**3. Industry Understanding**
- We know construction has seasonal slowdowns (monsoon Nov-Feb)
- We understand project-based cash flow (clients pay in 60-90 days)
- We work with contractors daily

**4. Down Payment Ability**
- Can you put down 15-25%?
- Shows commitment and financial capacity

**5. Business Potential**
- Are you bidding on government projects?
- Do you have CIDB registration?
- What's your future revenue potential?

### Why This Approach Works Better

**Example: Ahmad's Story**

Ahmad is a Class F contractor in Klang. In 2020, he had late payments on a personal loan (CCRIS score: 620). Bank Rakyat rejected his excavator loan application.

He came to Ing Heng Credit with:
- ✅ 3 active construction projects (RM 800K total)
- ✅ RM 35,000 cash for down payment
- ✅ 8 years in business
- ✅ Recent bank statements showing steady income

**We approved his RM 180,000 excavator financing in just 2 days.**

Why? Because we saw what the bank didn't: a successful contractor with temporary past issues but strong current business.

Ahmad now owns his excavator and has saved over RM 60,000 in rental costs.

## What "Bad Credit" Really Means in Malaysia

Let's break down the credit system so you understand what lenders see.

### CCRIS (Credit Bureau Malaysia)

**What it is:** Central Credit Reference Information System managed by Bank Negara Malaysia

**What it tracks:**
- All your loans and credit facilities
- Payment history (on-time vs late)
- Outstanding balances
- Credit applications

**Score Range:** 300-850
- 750+: Excellent (bank will love you)
- 650-749: Good (most banks will approve)
- 580-649: Fair (banks might reject, credit companies might approve)
- Below 580: Poor (banks will reject, credit companies evaluate case-by-case)

### CTOS (Credit Tip-Off Service)

**What it is:** Private credit reporting agency

**What it tracks:**
- Legal actions (summons, judgments)
- Bankruptcy records
- Trade bureau reports (supplier credit)
- Employer/landlord checks

**Score Range:** 300-850 (similar to CCRIS)

### Types of Credit Issues We Work With

**1. Late Payment History**
- Had 3-5 late payments in past 2 years
- Missed payments during pandemic/business slowdown
- Catch-up payments made, but record remains

**Why we might still approve:** One-time circumstances don't predict future behavior. If you have active projects now, we focus on that.

---

**2. High Debt-to-Income Ratio**
- Already have business loans, personal loans, car loans
- Monthly obligations high relative to income
- Banks say you're "over-leveraged"

**Why we might still approve:** Equipment financing generates income (new projects). We evaluate total business cash flow, not just debt ratio.

---

**3. CCRIS Score 580-650**
- Below bank's minimum threshold (usually 700)
- Past credit issues pulling score down
- Current payments on-time but history lingers

**Why we might still approve:** CCRIS score is backward-looking. We focus on forward potential. If excavator helps you win RM 500K project, that's what matters.

---

**4. CTOS Legal Record**
- Past summons from supplier dispute
- Legal action settled but record remains
- Small claims court judgment (under RM 10,000)

**Why we might still approve:** We review the nature of the legal issue. Business disputes happen. If resolved and not bankruptcy-related, we consider the full context.

---

**5. No Credit History (New Business)**
- Started business 1-2 years ago
- No significant loans or credit history
- Banks want 3+ years trading history

**Why we might still approve:** New doesn't mean risky. If you have active projects and down payment, we can work with you.

---

**6. Bankruptcy (Discharged)**
- Past bankruptcy, now discharged
- Clean payment history since discharge (6+ months)
- Rebuilding credit

**Why we might still approve:** Discharged bankruptcy means you've cleared your debts and gotten a fresh start. If business is performing well post-discharge, we evaluate current situation.

---

## Our Approval Process for Bad Credit Applications

### Step 1: Initial Inquiry (WhatsApp: +60 17-570 0889)

**What to send:**

7. Project photos (completed work)
8. Customer references

**Timeline:** Submit within 24 hours of receiving form

---

### Step 3: Credit Review

- CCRIS/CTOS reports (yes, we check, but it's not pass/fail)
- Current business performance
- Cash flow analysis
- Down payment verification
- Equipment value assessment

**What we DON'T do:**

**Timeline:** Review completed in 1-2 business days

---

### Step 4: Approval Decision

**✅ APPROVED (95% of cases)**
- Standard terms (if credit decent)
- Adjusted terms (if credit challenged)
- Higher down payment option (if needed to strengthen)

**⏸️ CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**
- Approved pending additional documents
- Approved with co-signer requirement
- Approved with larger down payment

**❌ DECLINED (5% of cases)**
- Active bankruptcy (not yet discharged)
- No verifiable business income
- Fraudulent documents

**Timeline:** Decision in 1-2 business days

---

### Step 5: Equipment Inspection & Finalization

**If buying used equipment:**

- Confirm ownership and transfer documents

**Final steps:**
1. Sign hire purchase agreement
2. Submit down payment
3. We pay seller
4. Equipment transferred to your name
5. Start monthly payments

---

## Documents Needed for Bad Credit Applications

The better your documentation, the easier the approval.

### Essential Documents (Must Have)

**1. Identification**
- IC copy (individual)
- SSM certificate (if Sdn Bhd)
- CIDB certificate (if Class F, G, etc.)

**2. Business Proof**
- Business registration
- Recent projects (LOAs, contracts)
- Bank statements (3 months minimum)

**3. Down Payment Proof**
- Bank statement showing available funds
- OR proof of savings/FD

### Supporting Documents (Strengthen Application)

**4. Payment History (Past 6 Months)**
- Utility bills (showing paid on-time)
- Rental payments (if renting office/yard)
- Existing loan statements (showing current payments)

**Why this helps:** Shows you're currently managing money well, even if past had issues

**5. Project Pipeline**
- Tender submissions (pending projects)
- Client LOIs (Letter of Intent)
- Quotations issued

**Why this helps:** Demonstrates future income potential

**6. Equipment Rental Invoices**
- Past 6 months of excavator rental receipts
- Proves you're already using equipment (rental → purchase is common path)

**Why this helps:** Shows equipment is essential to your business, not a speculative purchase

**7. Customer Testimonials/References**
- Letters from clients confirming projects
- Developer references
- Subcontractor agreements

**Why this helps:** Third-party validation of your business reputation

---

## How to Strengthen Your Application

Even with credit challenges, you can improve approval odds.

### 1. Increase Your Down Payment

**Standard down payment:** 10-20%
**With credit issues:** 15-25%

**Why it helps:**
- Shows commitment
- Reduces lender risk
- May improve interest rate

**Example:**
- Excavator price: RM 200,000
- Down payment 20%: RM 40,000
- Finance amount: RM 160,000

Lower finance amount = easier approval + lower monthly payment

---

### 2. Choose Used Equipment (Strategically)

**New excavator:** RM 250,000-400,000
**Used excavator (5-7 years):** RM 120,000-180,000

**Benefits:**
- Lower total loan amount
- Easier approval
- Proven equipment condition
- Better ROI (excavators last 15-20 years)

**We finance excavators up to 10 years old** (banks typically limit to 5 years).

---

### 3. Show Strong Current Cash Flow

**What we want to see:**
- Consistent monthly deposits (project payments)
- Healthy balance (not always near zero)
- Minimal overdrafts/bounced checks

**Tips:**
- Provide 6 months of statements (not just 3)
- Highlight project deposits
- Explain any large withdrawals (equipment purchases, subcontractor payments)

---

### 4. Get a Co-Signer (If Needed)

**Who can co-sign:**
- Business partner with good credit
- Family member in business
- Fellow contractor (co-owner scenario)

**What co-signer does:**
- Guarantees loan if you can't pay
- Adds their creditworthiness to application

**When it helps:**
- CCRIS below 600
- Very new business (under 1 year)
- Past bankruptcy (recently discharged)

---

### 5. Start with Smaller Equipment

**Strategy:** Build credit history with us first

**Example path:**
1. Year 1: Finance RM 80K mini excavator (easier approval)
2. Pay on-time for 12 months
3. Year 2: Finance RM 200K larger excavator (easier approval based on payment history)

**Why this works:** Proven payment history with us matters more than CCRIS score

---

### 6. Fix What You Can Fix

**Before applying:**

**✅ Settle small outstanding debts**
- Pay off outstanding utility bills
- Clear small credit card balances
- Settle supplier invoices

**✅ Update CCRIS/CTOS records**
- If debt is settled, ensure it's reflected
- Contact Bank Negara/CTOS to update

**✅ Prepare explanation letter**
- Brief explanation of credit issue
- What caused it (pandemic, project delay, medical emergency)
- How it's resolved now
- Why it won't happen again

---

## Interest Rates & Terms (Real Numbers)

Let's be transparent about costs.

### Interest Rates

**Excellent Credit (CCRIS 700+):**
- Rate: 7.5% - 9% annually
- Monthly rate: ~0.625% - 0.75%

**Fair Credit (CCRIS 600-699):**
- Rate: 9% - 11% annually
- Monthly rate: ~0.75% - 0.92%

**Poor Credit (CCRIS 580-599):**
- Rate: 10% - 12% annually
- Monthly rate: ~0.83% - 1.0%

**Why higher rates for lower credit?**
- Higher risk = higher rate (standard practice)
- Compensates for occasional defaults
- Still competitive vs alternatives (rental costs, loan sharks)

---

### Loan Terms

**Standard tenure:** 36-60 months (3-5 years)

**Example 1: New Excavator (Good Credit)**
- Equipment: New Caterpillar 320, RM 350,000
- Down payment: 15% (RM 52,500)
- Finance amount: RM 297,500
- Interest rate: 8.5% annually
- Tenure: 60 months
- **Monthly payment: RM 6,082**

**Example 2: Used Excavator (Fair Credit)**
- Equipment: Used Komatsu PC200 (6 years old), RM 180,000
- Down payment: 20% (RM 36,000)
- Finance amount: RM 144,000
- Interest rate: 10% annually
- Tenure: 48 months
- **Monthly payment: RM 3,660**

**Example 3: Used Mini Excavator (Poor Credit)**
- Equipment: Used Kubota U30 mini (5 years old), RM 80,000
- Down payment: 25% (RM 20,000)
- Finance amount: RM 60,000
- Interest rate: 11.5% annually
- Tenure: 36 months
- **Monthly payment: RM 1,969**

---

### Total Cost Comparison

**Example 2 above (Used Komatsu, Fair Credit):**

**Financing:**
- Monthly: RM 3,660 x 48 months = RM 175,680
- Down payment: RM 36,000
- **Total paid: RM 211,680**
- **Interest paid: RM 31,680**

**Rental Alternative:**
- Rental: RM 5,000/month x 48 months = RM 240,000
- **Total paid: RM 240,000**

**Savings by financing:** RM 28,320

**Plus:** You own the excavator after 48 months (asset worth RM 100K-120K)

**Verdict:** Even with higher interest rate due to credit issues, financing is MUCH better than renting long-term.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Can I get excavator financing with bad credit?

**Yes!** Credit companies like Ing Heng Credit evaluate each case individually. We approve 95% of applications including those with credit issues. We focus on current business performance and equipment as collateral, not just credit scores.

---

### 2. Will my CCRIS record disqualify me?

**No.** We look at your CCRIS report, but it's not an automatic disqualification. We review:
- Current financial situation
- Business potential
- Project pipeline
- Down payment capacity

Many contractors with CCRIS scores 600-650 get approved.

---

### 3. How long does approval take with bad credit?

We provide fast approval, typically 1-2 business days. This is much faster than traditional banks which take 2-4 weeks. Having credit challenges doesn't slow down our process.

---

### 4. What interest rate can I expect with bad credit?

Interest rates for applicants with credit challenges typically range from **10-12% annually**, compared to 7.5-9% for those with excellent credit.

**Why higher?** Higher risk = higher rate. This is standard across all lenders.

**Is it worth it?** Yes. Even at 12%, financing is much cheaper than renting long-term (RM 5,000-6,000/month).

---

### 5. Do I need a higher down payment with bad credit?

Down payment typically ranges from **15-25%** for applicants with credit challenges, compared to 10-20% for those with strong credit.

**Why?** Larger down payment reduces risk and may improve your interest rate.

---

### 6. Can I finance used excavators with bad credit?

**Yes!** We finance excavators up to 10 years old. Used equipment is often easier to approve because:
- Lower total loan amount
- Lower monthly payments
- Lower risk for us
- Better ROI for you

---

### 7. What if I was bankrupt but now discharged?

We can work with you if:
- Bankruptcy is discharged (not active)
- Clean payment history for 6-12 months post-discharge
- Active business with verifiable income

Your fresh start matters to us.

---

### 8. Will you check my CCRIS/CTOS?

- We review the full context
- We focus on current situation
- 95% approval rate (including credit issues)

---

### 9. Can I apply if I have other business loans?

**Yes.** We evaluate total cash flow, not just debt-to-income ratio. If your business generates sufficient revenue to cover all obligations plus the excavator payment, we can approve.

---

### 10. What if my bank rejected me?

**Apply with us.** Bank rejection doesn't mean credit company rejection. We use different criteria. Many of our customers were rejected by banks first.

---

### 11. Can I use a co-signer to improve approval?

**Yes.** A co-signer with good credit can strengthen your application and may:
- Increase approval odds
- Lower interest rate
- Reduce down payment requirement

---

### 12. Do you finance for new contractors?

**Yes.** Even if you've been in business 1-2 years (banks want 3+). We look at:
- Active projects
- CIDB registration
- Business pipeline
- Down payment

New doesn't mean risky.
