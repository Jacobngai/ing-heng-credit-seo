## Port Klang Logistics: Which Brand Wins?



        


          With Port Klang handling **14.64 million TEUs** in 2024, container trucking is a major business segment. Our recommendation:
        



        
          

#### Best for Port Klang: Isuzu


          


            Container movements involve frequent short trips and waiting time. Isuzu's fuel efficiency during idle and stop-go traffic provides maximum savings.
          


          

- **Average Port Trip:** 30-50 km (warehouse to port to warehouse)
- **Daily Trips:** 3-5 trips/day typical
- **Annual Distance:** 40,000-60,000 km/year
- **Fuel Savings:** RM3,000-5,000/year vs. competitors
