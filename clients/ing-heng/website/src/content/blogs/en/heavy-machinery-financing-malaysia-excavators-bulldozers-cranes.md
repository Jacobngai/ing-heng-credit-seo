## Executive Summary: Powering Malaysia's Construction

**The Big Picture:**
Construction projects in Malaysia (ECRL, Pan Borneo Highway, RTS Link) are demanding more heavy machinery than ever. But buying a new RM 400,000 excavator cash is impossible for most SMEs.

**The Solution:**
Heavy machinery financing (Industrial Hire Purchase) allows you to acquire high-value assets with minimal upfront capital.

**Key Features (2026):**
*   **High Margin:** Up to **100% Financing** (0% Deposit) for qualified contractors.
*   **Old Machines OK:** We finance equipment up to **20 years old** (e.g., 2006 models).
*   **Flexible Tenure:** Stretch payments up to **5-7 years** to lower monthly commitments.

**Verdict:** Whether you need a 20-ton excavator or a 50-ton crane, financing is the smart way to scale your fleet without draining cash flow.

## 3. Monthly Installment Calculator (Estimates)

How much will it cost you per month? Here are indicative figures based on a **5-year tenure** and **5% interest**.

| Machine Type | Estimated Price (Used/Recond) | Loan Amount (90%) | Monthly Installment (Approx) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 4. The 0% Down Payment Advantage

Traditionally, buying a RM 200,000 excavator meant paying **RM 40,000 (20%) upfront**. For many SMEs, that cash is better used for diesel, wages, and materials.

**At Ing Heng Credit, we offer:**
*   **Zero Down Payment:** For companies with 2+ years track record and decent bank statements.
*   **Low Deposit (10%):** For newer companies (1-2 years).
*   **Trade-In as Deposit:** Trade in your old, broken machine as your down payment for a newer unit.

## 5. Documents Required for Heavy Machinery Loan

The list is short and simple.

1.  **Company Registration:** SSM (Form 9/24/49/M&A or Form D/E).
2.  **Director's IC:** Front and back copy.
3.  **Bank Statements:** Latest 6 months (Company account).
4.  **Quotation:** From the seller (Dealer or Direct Owner).
5.  **Project Documents (Optional):** Letter of Award (LOA) or Contracts to prove future income.

> **Buying from a Friend/Direct Owner?**
> No problem. We can finance "Direct Owner" deals. You act as the buyer, they act as the seller. We pay them directly.

## 6. Why Choose Ing Heng for Heavy Equipment?

*   **We Know Machines:** We know a Kobelco Mark-8 is different from a Mark-3. We value equipment accurately, often higher than generalist banks.
*   **Old Iron Friendly:** A 2006 Caterpillar D6R is still a beast. Banks see "old iron"; we see a productive asset.
*   **Fast Disbursal:** Once approved and signed, we pay the seller within **24-48 hours**. Get your machine to the site immediately.
