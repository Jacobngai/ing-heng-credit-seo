## Executive Summary: Mechanize to Monetize

**The Challenge:**
Labor shortage in plantations is critical. Workers are expensive and hard to find.
Oil palm fruit (FFB) left on the tree = Lost Money.

**The Solution:**
**Mechanization.**
A single 4WD Tractor with a grabber can replace 5 workers.
*   **Kubota M9540:** Perfect for infield collection.
*   **Massey Ferguson 4708:** Tough, simple, reliable.

**Key Offer:**
*   **Seasonal Payments:** Pay when you harvest (discussable).
*   **Low Interest:** 3.5% - 4.5% for new units.

**Verdict:** Stop relying on manual labor. Buy a tractor and control your own harvest.

## 1. What Agriculture Equipment Can You Finance?

We finance more than just tractors.

### Field Machinery
*   **4WD Tractors:** 80HP - 120HP (MF, New Holland, John Deere).
*   **Mini Tractors:** 20HP - 50HP (Kubota L-Series). For spraying/fertilizing.
*   **Crawlers:** Morooka carriers for swampy land.

### Implements (Bundled)
*   **Trailers:** 5-Ton, 10-Ton tipping trailers.
*   **Grabbers:** Hydraulic FFB grabbers.
*   **Rotary Tillers:** For land prep.

**Note:** We can finance the **Tractor + Trailer + Grabber** as a single package loan.

## 2. Financing Terms for Farmers/Planters

Agriculture loans are slightly different from construction loans.

| Feature | Standard Loan | Agri Scheme (Ing Heng) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Down Payment** | 20% | **10% - 20%** |
| **Interest Rate** | 4.0% - 5.0% | **3.5% - 4.5%** |
| **Tenure** | 5 Years | **5 - 7 Years** |
| **Repayment** | Monthly | **Flexible (Season Based)** |

## 3. Top Brands for Financing (Resale Value)

Banks love these brands because they hold value.

1.  **Kubota (Japan):** The King of Padi & Small Plantations. Easy loan approval.
2.  **Massey Ferguson (AGCO):** The classic workhorse. Parts available in every kampung.
3.  **New Holland (CNH):** Strong, modern, comfortable.
4.  **John Deere (USA):** Premium, expensive, but lasts forever.

**Warning:**
Be careful buying cheap, unbranded Chinese tractors. Financing is very difficult (50% margin only) because resale value is near zero after 3 years.

## 4. ROI: Manual Labor vs Mechanization

**Scenario:** 100 Acre Oil Palm Estate.
*   **Manual:** 10 Workers @ RM 2,000 = RM 20,000 / month.
*   **Mechanized:** 1 Tractor + 2 Workers = RM 4,000 (Loan) + RM 4,000 (Wages) + RM 2,000 (Fuel).
*   **Total Cost:** RM 10,000 / month.

**Savings:** **RM 10,000 / month.**
The tractor pays for itself in < 2 years.

## 5. Documents for Agriculture Loan

1.  **Land Title (Grant):** Prove you own the land or have a lease agreement.
2.  **MPOB License:** For Oil Palm planters.
3.  **Bank Statement:** 6 Months showing FFB sales income.
4.  **IC:** Owner.

**Tip:**
If you sell FFB to a specific mill, get a "Supply Letter" or "Income Statement" from the mill. It strengthens your application.

## Conclusion

Farming is a business, not a hobby. Invest in the right machinery to secure your yield.
Don't let fruit rot on the ground because workers didn't show up.
