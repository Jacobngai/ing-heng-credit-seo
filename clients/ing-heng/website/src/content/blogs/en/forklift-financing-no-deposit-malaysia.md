## Understanding No Deposit Forklift Financing

When lenders offer zero deposit:

- No upfront cash payment required
- Monthly payments are higher (more borrowed = more interest)
- Total cost is higher over loan term

### The Reality: Who Actually Qualifies?

**True zero deposit financing** is available, but only for:
- Excellent credit score (750+ CTOS/CCRIS)
- Established businesses (2+ years operating)
- Strong financial statements
- Stable revenue history
- Low debt-to-income ratio

**Most applicants** (90%+) receive offers requiring 10-20% deposit.

## How to Increase Your Chances for Zero Deposit Approval

If you want 100% financing, here is how to improve your odds.

### 1. Improve Your Credit Score

**Check your CTOS/CCRIS report:**
- Visit CTOS or Bank Negara website
- Order your credit report (RM 10-30)
- Look for errors and dispute them
- Pay off small debts to boost score

**Timeline:** 3-6 months to improve score by 50-100 points

### 2. Strengthen Your Financial Statements

**Prepare these documents:**
- 2 years of audited accounts (if available)
- 6 months of bank statements showing positive cash flow
- Tax returns (Borang B or BE)
- SSM certificate and latest MBRS update
- Business license or permits

**Make sure your statements show:**
- Consistent revenue growth
- Positive monthly cash flow
- Low debt levels
- Regular customer payments

### 3. Consider Trade-In Options

If you have old equipment:
- Trade in your existing forklift
- Use trade-in value as "deposit"
- Reduces loan amount needed
- Improves approval odds

**Example:** Old forklift worth RM 15,000 = 15% deposit on RM 100,000 purchase

### 4. Get a Co-Borrower or Guarantor

**Adding a co-borrower helps if they have:**
- Better credit score than you
- Additional income to support loan
- Clean credit history
- Business owner or director

**Risk:** Co-borrower is equally responsible for repayment

### 5. Choose Used Instead of New

Used forklifts cost less:
- RM 40,000-80,000 vs RM 100,000-200,000 for new
- Lower loan amount = easier 100% approval
- Still 5-10 years of useful life remaining

**We finance used forklifts up to 10 years old**

---

## Alternative Low-Deposit Options

If zero deposit is not available, these alternatives preserve cash flow.

### Option 1: 10% Down, Extended Terms

- Pay only RM 10,000 upfront
- Extend loan to 72 months (6 years)
- Monthly payment drops to RM 1,460
- Preserves working capital for operations

### Option 2: Delayed Payment Plans

- Pay deposit in 3-6 installments
- Spread RM 20,000 over 6 months = RM 3,333/month
- Less impact on cash flow
- Start using forklift immediately

### Option 3: Rent-to-Own Programs

- Low initial payment (RM 2,000-5,000)
- Rent for 12-24 months
- Option to purchase at end
- Rental payments applied to purchase price

**Best for:** New businesses under 1 year old

### Option 4: Stop Renting, Start Saving

**Current situation:**
- Renting forklift: RM 1,500-3,000/month
- No asset at end
- Rental costs forever

**Instead, finance with 10% deposit:**
- Upfront: RM 10,000
- Monthly payment: RM 1,782
- Own asset after 5 years
- **Total savings: RM 100,000+ over rental**
