## The DOSH Reality: Compliance is Not Optional



      

It's 8 AM on a Tuesday. DOSH inspectors arrive at your warehouse. They check your forklift documentation. One forklift lacks current FMI certification. Another hasn't been inspected in 18 months. A third shows no evidence of operator training records.



      

The result? Immediate stop-work order. RM50,000 fine. Operations shut down for 2 weeks. Lost revenue: RM200,000. Client relationships damaged.



      

This scenario plays out across Malaysia weekly. DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety and Health) regulations for forklift operations are strict—and enforcement is increasing.



      

## What is DOSH and Why Does It Matter?



      

DOSH is Malaysia's occupational safety authority under the Ministry of Human Resources. For forklift operations, DOSH enforces:



      

- **Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA)** – Primary legislation governing workplace safety
- **Forklift and Industrial Truck Regulations** – Specific rules for forklift operations
- **FMI (Factories and Machinery Act 1967)** – Equipment certification requirements



      

**Key Point:** DOSH regulations apply to ALL forklift operations in Malaysia:
      
• Warehouses and distribution centers
      
• Construction sites
      
• Manufacturing facilities
      
• Ports and logistics hubs



      

Exemptions exist only for specific agricultural applications with limited use.



      

## 2024 DOSH Forklift Requirements: What You Must Know



      

### 1. FMI Registration and Certification



      

**Requirement:** All forklifts must be registered with DOSH and display a valid FMI (Factories and Machinery) registration number.



      

**Process:**
      
• Registration before operation (new forklifts)
      
• Inspection and certification by DOSH-approved inspector
      
• Issuance of FMI plate/certificate



      

**Validity:**
      
• New forklifts: Certification valid for 1 year initially
      
• Subsequent certifications: Valid for 2-3 years depending on usage and condition
      
• Inspection required: Every 12-24 months



      

### 2. Operator Training and Licensing



      

**Requirement:** All forklift operators must complete DOSH-recognized training and hold valid certification.



      

**Training Components:**
      
• Classroom theory (safety regulations, load calculations, hazard recognition)
      
• Practical operation (driving, lifting, stacking, emergency procedures)
      
• Written and practical examinations



      

**License Validity:**
      
• Forklift operator license: Valid for 3 years
      
• Refresher training: Required after accidents or near-misses
      
• Renewal: Requires re-examination



      

### 3. Equipment Safety Features



      

**Mandatory Features (2024 Standards):**
      
• Overhead guard (protection from falling objects)
      
• Seatbelt (operator restraint system)
      
• Backup alarm (audible warning when reversing)
      
• Warning lights (flashing lights during operation)
      
• Load rating plate (clearly visible capacity information)
      
• Horn (audible warning device)
      
• Fire extinguisher (minimum 2kg ABC rating)



      

### 4. Maintenance and Inspection Records



      

**Requirement:** Forklifts must undergo regular maintenance with documented records.



      

**Inspection Schedule:**
      
• Daily: Pre-shift inspection by operator (checklist required)
      
• Monthly: Basic maintenance by qualified mechanic
      
• Annually: Comprehensive inspection by DOSH-approved inspector



      

**Documentation:**
      
• Maintenance logbook (all repairs and servicing recorded)
      
• Inspection certificates (current FMI certificate displayed)
      
• Operator training records (available for DOSH review)



      

### 5. Workplace Safety Requirements



      

**Forklift Operating Areas Must Have:**
      
• Designated travel paths (marked lanes)
      
• Speed limit signs (typically 15 km/h for forklifts)
      
• Pedestrian separation (barriers or marked walkways)
      
• Adequate lighting (minimum 200 lux for driving areas)
      
• Floor load capacity rating (supports forklift + maximum load)



      

## The Cost of Non-Compliance: What Violations Really Cost



      

### Fine Schedule (2024)



      

**Unregistered Forklift (No FMI):** RM10,000 - RM50,000 per forklift
      
**Uncertified Operator:** RM5,000 - RM20,000 per operator
      
**Expired Certification:** RM5,000 - RM15,000 per forklift
      
**No Safety Features (missing backup alarm, seatbelt, etc.):** RM2,000 - RM10,000 per violation
      
**No Maintenance Records:** RM3,000 - RM10,000
      
**Workplace Safety Violations:** RM5,000 - RM30,000



      

### Operational Costs



      

**Beyond Fines:**
      
• Stop-work orders (operations halt until violations corrected)
      
• Equipment seizure (non-compliant forklifts impounded)
      
• Business license suspension (repeat violations)
      
• Legal liability (accidents involving non-compliant equipment = gross negligence)
      
• Insurance claim denial (non-compliance voids coverage)



      

**Real-World Example:**
      
Warehouse with 8 forklifts, 2 unregistered + 3 expired certifications
      
• Fines: RM120,000
      
• Stop-work order: 10 days
      
• Lost revenue: RM150,000
      
• Client contract cancellations: RM300,000
      
**Total Cost:** RM570,000



      

## Financing DOSH-Compliant Equipment: What to Look For



      

### 1. New vs Used Equipment Certification



      

**New Forklifts:**
      
• Manufacturer provides DOSH-compliant safety features
      
• Dealer handles initial FMI registration
      
• Easier certification process (no prior inspection issues)
      
• Higher cost but full compliance assurance



      

**Used Forklifts:**
      
• Require DOSH inspection before financing approval
      
• Must have all safety features functional
      
• Previous registration history must be clear
      
• Lower cost but requires careful compliance verification



      

### 2. Finance Only Certified Equipment



      

At Ing Heng Credit, we verify DOSH compliance before financing:
      
• Current FMI certificate (or verification of eligibility for certification)
      
• All safety features present and functional
      
• Maintenance documentation (for used equipment)
      
• Dealer compliance certification (for new equipment)



      

### 3. Include Compliance Costs in Financing



      

When financing a forklift, include these compliance costs:



      

**New Forklift:**
      
• Equipment cost: RM120,000
      
• FMI registration: RM1,500-RM3,000
      
• Initial inspection: RM800-RM1,500
      
• Operator training (2 staff): RM2,000-RM4,000
      
**Total Financed:** RM124,300-RM128,500



      

**Used Forklift:**
      
• Equipment cost: RM60,000
      
• Compliance inspection: RM1,000-RM2,000
      
• Safety feature upgrades (if needed): RM3,000-RM8,000
      
• FMI transfer/certification: RM1,500-RM3,000
      
**Total Financed:** RM65,500-RM73,000



      

By bundling compliance costs into financing, you avoid surprise expenses that could delay certification.



      

## The Financing Advantage: How Ing Heng Credit Ensures Compliance



      

### 1. We Verify DOSH Status Before Approving



      

Unlike banks that finance any equipment meeting basic criteria, we specifically check:
      
• FMI certificate validity
      
• Safety feature completeness
      
• Compliance inspection eligibility



      

**Why This Matters:**
      
We won't finance a forklift that will be immediately impounded by DOSH. This protects your investment—and your business operations.



      

### 2. 0% Down Payment Preserves Compliance Budget



      

Compliance costs money. Training, registration, inspections, safety features—these expenses add up. When you pay 10-20% down payment (RM12,000-RM24,000 on a RM120,000 forklift), you drain the budget needed for compliance.



      

With 0% down payment, preserve that capital. Use it for:
      
• Operator training programs
      
• Safety feature upgrades
      
• Compliance audit preparation



      

### 3. Fast Approval = Faster Compliance



      

DOSH doesn't care about financing delays. They require compliance—period. If your current forklift is non-compliant (expired certification, failed inspection), you need replacement fast.



      

We approve in 24-48 hours. Bank approval takes 2-4 weeks. In 4 weeks, DOSH could shut down your operations. Fast approval protects your business continuity.



      

### 4. Used Equipment Compliance Expertise



      

Banks typically won't finance used forklifts. We do—and we understand compliance nuances:
      
• Which used models are DOSH-approved
      
• What compliance upgrades cost for older equipment
      
• How to transfer FMI registration properly



      

This expertise prevents costly mistakes—like financing a used forklift that can't be certified.



      

## Compliance Checklist: What to Verify Before Financing



      

### New Forklift Checklist


      

- ✓ DOSH-approved model (not all imported models meet Malaysian standards)
- ✓ Manufacturer provides FMI registration assistance
- ✓ All 2024 safety features included (backup alarm, seatbelt, overhead guard, etc.)
- ✓ Load rating plate visible and in Malay/English
- ✓ Operator manual includes DOSH safety guidelines
- ✓ Dealer warranty covers compliance-related repairs



      

### Used Forklift Checklist


      

- ✓ Current FMI certificate (or verification of eligibility)
- ✓ No major accidents or structural damage (affects certification)
- ✓ All safety features functional (seatbelt, backup alarm, lights, horn)
- ✓ Maintenance records available (last 12 months minimum)
- ✓ Clear ownership history (no stolen or disputed equipment)
- ✓ Pre-purchase DOSH inspection completed



      

## Operator Training Financing: Don't Overlook This



      

The best forklift is useless without certified operators. Training costs are significant but non-negotiable:



      

**DOSH-Recognized Forklift Training Cost:**
      
• Basic operator course: RM1,500-RM3,000 per person
      
• Duration: 2-3 days
      
• Certification: Valid for 3 years
      
• Renewal course: RM800-RM1,500 per person



      

**Include Training in Financing:**
      
When acquiring 2 forklifts requiring 4 trained operators, include RM6,000-RM12,000 for training in your financing amount. This ensures:
      
• Operators certified before equipment arrives
      
• No operational delays due to lack of licensed operators
      
• Full compliance from Day 1 of operation



      

## Real-World Compliance: Success Stories



      

### Avoiding Shutdown – Selangor Warehouse



      

"DOSH inspection found 3 of our 8 forklifts had expired certifications. They gave us 7 days to rectify or face shutdown. We needed 3 replacement forklifts immediately. Applied to Ing Heng Credit Monday, approved Tuesday, purchased Wednesday. All forklifts certified and compliant by Friday. No shutdown, no fine. The 0% down payment preserved cash we used for operator recertification training."


      

*— Kumar Rajan, Warehouse Manager*



      

### Compliance Upgrade – Penang Logistics



      

"We bought cheap used forklifts from an auction. Didn't realize they didn't meet 2024 DOSH standards (no backup alarms, missing overhead guards). DOSH flagged us. Needed replacements. Ing Heng helped us find compliant used equipment, financed including safety upgrades. Turned a RM50,000 fine risk into a compliant fleet. The key was their DOSH expertise—they identified compliance issues before we financed."


      

*— Lim Chee Keong, Operations Director*



      

## Preparing for DOSH Inspections: Your Defense Strategy



      

### Documentation Ready



      

Keep these accessible for every forklift:
      
• FMI certificate (current, on display)
      
• Maintenance logbook (up-to-date)
      
• Daily inspection checklists (last 6 months minimum)
      
• Operator training certificates (all current operators)
      
• Load rating plate (legible, in correct language)



      

### Self-Audit Quarterly



      

Before DOSH arrives, conduct your own audit:
      
• Verify FMI certificate dates
      
• Test all safety features (backup alarm, seatbelt, lights, horn)
      
• Check maintenance records completeness
      
• Confirm operator licenses are current
      
• Review workplace safety markings (lanes, signs, pedestrian areas)



      

### Correct Issues Immediately



      

If you identify compliance issues:
      
• Remove non-compliant equipment from service immediately
      
• Schedule repairs or replacements without delay
      
• Document correction actions (shows good faith to DOSH)
      
• Consider proactive replacement if repairs exceed 50% of equipment value



      

## The Bottom Line: Compliance is Cheaper Than Violations



      

DOSH compliance costs money. Training, certification, safety features, inspections—these are real expenses. But violations cost far more in fines, shutdowns, and lost business.



      

Financing DOSH-compliant forklifts with 0% down payment allows you to:
      
• Acquire compliant equipment immediately
      
• Include certification costs in financing
      
• Preserve working capital for operations
      
• Avoid fines and shutdowns through proactive compliance



      

Don't risk your business on non-compliant equipment. Finance certified forklifts from Ing Heng Credit—we verify DOSH status before approving, protecting your investment and your operations.
