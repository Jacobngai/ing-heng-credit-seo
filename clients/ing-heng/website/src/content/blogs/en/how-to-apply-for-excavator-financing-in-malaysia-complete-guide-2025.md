Buying an excavator is a big investment for contractors. You need it to win projects and grow your business. But excavators cost RM 150,000 to RM 800,000 or more. Most contractors cannot pay cash.

That’s why excavator financing exists. It lets you own equipment by paying monthly. You can start earning income immediately while spreading the cost over 3-5 years.

**In this guide, you’ll learn:**

• How excavator financing works in Malaysia

• What documents you need

• Step-by-step application process

• Tips to get fast approval

• Common mistakes to avoid

This guide is written for Malaysian contractors like you. We’ve helped hundreds of contractors secure excavator financing. Let’s get started.

## What is Excavator Financing?

Excavator financing is a loan that helps you buy construction equipment. You pay a small down payment (10-20%). Then you pay monthly installments over 3-5 years.

**How it works:**

• You choose the excavator you want

• You apply for financing with a lender

• Lender approves and pays the dealer

• You receive the excavator

• You pay monthly until loan is finished

• Excavator is yours after final payment

**Types of excavator financing:**

**Hire Purchase (Most Common)**

• You own the excavator after final payment

• Interest rate: 2.88% - 4.5% per year

• Tenure: 36-60 months

• Down payment: 10-20%

• Fixed monthly payment

**Business Loan**

• Get cash to buy equipment

• Faster approval (3-5 days)

• Flexible use of funds

• Similar rates to hire purchase

At Ing Heng Credit, we offer both options. Most contractors choose hire purchase because it’s simple and structured.

## Why Finance Your Excavator?

**Save Your Cash**
Don’t spend RM 500,000 cash on one excavator. Keep that money for daily operations, fuel, repairs, and worker salaries. Monthly payments are RM 3,000 - RM 8,000, which is affordable from project income.

**Start Earning Immediately**
Rental costs RM 800 - RM 2,000 per day. After 10 rental days, you could have paid for one month’s loan payment. With your own excavator, all project income is yours.

**Win More Projects**
Many tenders require owned equipment. Government projects and large developers check if you own your machines. Without owned equipment, you cannot bid on profitable projects.

**Tax Benefits**
Equipment financing provides tax deductions. You can claim interest payments and depreciation. Talk to your accountant to maximize these benefits.

**Improve Credit Rating**
Making regular payments builds your business credit. This helps you get bigger financing later for fleet expansion or other equipment.

## Step 1: Determine Your Equipment Needs

Before applying, know exactly what you need. This makes the process faster and shows lenders you are serious.

**Excavator Size Guide:**

**Mini Excavators (1.5 - 6 tons)**

• Best for: Small residential projects, landscaping, utility work

• Price range: RM 80,000 - RM 180,000

• Monthly payment: RM 1,500 - RM 3,500

**Mid-Size Excavators (7 - 15 tons)**

• Best for: Road work, medium building projects, drainage

• Price range: RM 200,000 - RM 450,000

• Monthly payment: RM 4,000 - RM 8,500

**Large Excavators (16 - 25 tons)**

• Best for: Major earthworks, large infrastructure projects

• Price range: RM 500,000 - RM 800,000+

• Monthly payment: RM 9,000 - RM 15,000

**New vs Used Excavators:**

Most contractors (70-80%) buy used excavators. Here’s why:

**Used Excavators (Up to 10 Years Old)**

• 40-60% cheaper than new

• Better immediate ROI

• Lower monthly payments

• Proven track record

• We finance up to 10 years old (banks only do 5 years)

**New Excavators**

• Latest technology

• Full warranty

• Lower maintenance first 3 years

• Better for heavy daily use

**Expert Tip:** If you’re a new contractor or doing seasonal work, start with a 5-7 year old used excavator. Save money on monthly payments. Upgrade to new when your business is more established.

## Step 2: Calculate Your Budget

Know your numbers before applying. This prevents overcommitting and ensures loan approval.

**Monthly Payment Formula:**

Your monthly payment depends on:

• Equipment price

• Down payment (10-20%)

• Interest rate (2.88% - 4.5%)

• Tenure (36-60 months)

**Example Calculation:**

Used 8-ton excavator: RM 250,000

• Down payment (15%): RM 37,500

• Loan amount: RM 212,500

• Interest rate: 3.5% per year

• Tenure: 48 months

• Monthly payment: RM 4,750

**Use Our Free Calculator:**
Visit [inghengcredit.com/calculator](/en/calculator) to calculate your exact monthly payment. Input your equipment price, down payment, and tenure to see instant results.

**Income Requirement:**

Your monthly business income should be **at least 3 times** your monthly payment.

Example:

• Monthly payment: RM 4,750

• Minimum monthly income: RM 14,250

This ensures you can cover payments even during slow months (monsoon season).

**Cash Flow Planning:**

Construction has seasonal patterns:

• Monsoon season (Nov-Feb): Slower projects, lower income

• Peak season (Mar-Oct): More projects, higher income

Plan for this. Keep 3 months of payment reserves for monsoon months.

## Step 3: Gather Required Documents

Having complete documentation speeds up approval. Here’s what you need:

**Personal Documents:**

• ✅ IC (Identity Card) or passport photocopy

• ✅ Utility bill (TNB, water) for address proof

• ✅ Driver’s license (if applicable)

**Business Documents:**

• ✅ SSM registration (Form 24/49 for companies)

• ✅ Business profile (CIDB registration, PKK license)

• ✅ Company stamp (Sdn Bhd/Partnership)

**Financial Documents:**

• ✅ 3 months bank statements (business or personal)

• ✅ KWSP statement (EPF)

• ✅ Income tax return (BE form for individuals, Form C for companies)

• ✅ Business invoices or contracts (proof of projects)

**Equipment Documents:**

• ✅ Quotation or invoice from dealer

• ✅ Equipment specifications and photos

• ✅ Grant details (for used equipment)

**Don’t Have All Documents?**

No problem. At Ing Heng Credit, we are flexible. We understand many contractors have informal income or limited documentation. We work with what you have.

**Minimum Requirements:**

• Business registration (SSM)

• IC

• 3 months bank statements

• Equipment quotation

That’s it. Much simpler than banks.

## Step 4: Choose the Right Financing Provider

Not all financing companies are the same. Here’s how to choose:

— Ing Heng Credit Team, 40 years in equipment financing

## Step 7: Sign Agreement &amp; Documentation

After approval, you’ll receive an offer letter. Here’s what to look for:

**Key Terms to Check:**

**Loan Amount**

• Confirm it matches your equipment price

• Check down payment amount

**Interest Rate**

• Fixed or variable rate?

• Flat rate or reducing balance?

• Typical range: 2.88% - 4.5%

**Monthly Payment**

• Exact amount (RM)

• Number of payments

• Payment due date (usually 1st or 15th of month)

**Tenure**

• Number of months (36, 48, 60)

• Total repayment period

**Insurance**

• Is insurance included?

• Coverage amount and terms

• Insurance premium (if separate)

**Early Settlement**

• Can you pay off early?

• Any penalties or fees?

• Usually allows early settlement after 6-12 months

**Late Payment**

• Late payment penalties

• Grace period (usually 7 days)

**Default Terms**

• What happens if you miss payments?

• Equipment repossession process

**Signing Process:**

• 
**Review Offer Letter** - Take your time. Ask questions. Understand every term.

• 
**Negotiate if Needed** - Interest rate slightly high? Ask. Need longer tenure? Request it. We want you to succeed, so terms should work for you.

• 
**Sign Agreement** - Once satisfied, sign the hire purchase agreement. Can be done in office or via courier.

• 
**Insurance Activation** - We arrange equipment insurance. Coverage starts before equipment delivery.

• 
**Down Payment** - Transfer down payment to our account. We confirm receipt.

• 
**Equipment Delivery Coordination** - We pay dealer. Dealer delivers excavator to your site.

**Timeline:**

• Offer received to signing: 1-3 days

• Signing to equipment delivery: 3-5 days

• Total from approval to delivery: 5-7 days

## Step 8: Receive Your Excavator

Final step! Here’s what happens:

**Delivery Coordination:**

• **Dealer Contact** - After down payment, dealer contacts you to schedule delivery

• **Site Preparation** - Ensure delivery site is accessible for lowbed trailer

• **Inspection** - Inspect excavator thoroughly before signing delivery order

• **Delivery Acknowledgement** - Sign delivery order confirming equipment received

**Equipment Inspection Checklist:**

Before signing delivery order, check:

**Visual Inspection:**

• ✅ No major body damage or rust

• ✅ Tracks or wheels in good condition

• ✅ Hydraulic hoses intact (no leaks)

• ✅ Bucket and attachments present

• ✅ Cabin glass and doors functional

• ✅ All lights and signals working

**Operational Test:**

• ✅ Engine starts smoothly

• ✅ No excessive smoke or noise

• ✅ Hydraulics respond smoothly

• ✅ All functions work (swing, boom, arm, bucket)

• ✅ Controls responsive

• ✅ No error lights on dashboard

**Documentation:**

• ✅ Grant (ownership document)

• ✅ Maintenance records (if used)

• ✅ Warranty documents (if new)

• ✅ Operating manual

• ✅ Spare key provided

**If You Find Issues:**

Don’t sign delivery order until issues are resolved. Contact dealer immediately. Common issues:

• Minor repairs needed

• Missing documentation

• Equipment doesn’t match quotation

Dealer must fix issues before you accept delivery.

**After Delivery:**

**First Payment Due:**
Your first monthly payment is usually due 30-45 days after delivery. Mark your calendar.

**Insurance Confirmation:**
Confirm insurance is active. You’ll receive insurance certificate within 7 days.

**Maintenance Schedule:**
Set up regular maintenance schedule. Good maintenance protects your investment and prevents breakdowns.

**Payment Method:**
Set up auto-debit or bank transfer. Never miss payments to maintain good credit.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from other contractors’ mistakes:

**Mistake 1: Not Calculating Total Costs**

Many contractors only look at monthly payment. But total cost includes:

• Monthly loan payment

• Diesel fuel (RM 3,000 - RM 8,000/month depending on usage)

• Maintenance (RM 500 - RM 2,000/month)

• Insurance (included in financing)

• Spare parts

• Operator salary

**Solution:** Budget for all costs before committing. Your total monthly cost is 1.5x - 2x the loan payment.

**Mistake 2: Buying Too Big or Too Expensive**

New contractors often want the biggest, newest excavator. Then they struggle with payments during slow months.

**Solution:** Start with mid-size used equipment. Upgrade when business is stable and profitable.

**Mistake 3: Incomplete Documentation**

Submitting incomplete documents delays approval. You might lose the equipment to another buyer.

**Solution:** Prepare all documents before applying. Use our document checklist above.

**Mistake 4: Not Reading the Agreement**

Some contractors sign without reading. Later they discover unfavorable terms or hidden fees.

**Solution:** Read every page. Ask questions. Take your time. A good lender will explain everything clearly.

**Mistake 5: Overcommitting Cash Flow**

Your monthly payment should not exceed 30% of monthly revenue. Many contractors overextend and struggle during monsoon season.

**Solution:** Follow the 3x rule: Monthly income should be 3x monthly payment. This leaves buffer for slow months.

**Mistake 6: Ignoring Seasonal Cash Flow**

Construction slows during monsoon (Nov-Feb). If you don’t plan for this, you’ll miss payments.

**Solution:** Save 3 months of payments as reserve. Or request flexible payment plans that reduce during monsoon months.

**Mistake 7: Not Maintaining Equipment**

Skipping maintenance to save money leads to expensive breakdowns. Downtime means lost revenue and missed payments.

**Solution:** Follow manufacturer maintenance schedule religiously. Prevention is cheaper than repair.

## Tips for Fast Approval

Want to speed up your application? Here’s how:

**Tip 1: Have Complete Documents Ready**

Don’t wait to find documents. Prepare everything before applying:

• All documents in our checklist

• Clear photocopies or photos

• Organized by category

• Current statements (not 6 months old)

**Tip 2: Choose Equipment First**

Get quotation from dealer before applying. This shows lenders you’re serious and ready to buy.

**Tip 3: Apply During Off-Peak Season**

Jan-Feb and July-Aug are slower months for applications. Apply during these times for faster processing.

**Tip 4: Be Honest and Transparent**

Hiding credit issues or providing false information delays approval. Be upfront about:

• Credit problems (late payments, defaults)

• Business challenges

• Other commitments

We work with honest contractors. Transparency builds trust and speeds approval.

**Tip 5: Respond Quickly**

When we request additional documents or clarification, respond within 24 hours. Delayed responses delay approval.

**Tip 6: Have Strong Business Proof**

Strong business documentation increases approval confidence:

• Project contracts for next 6-12 months

• Invoices showing steady income

• Bank statements showing regular deposits

• CIDB registration and classification

**Tip 7: Improve Your Credit Score**

Before applying:

• Pay off small debts

• Clear any CCRIS/CTOS defaults

• Make current loan payments on time

• Check your credit report for errors

Even improving from 580 to 620 increases approval chances and may reduce interest rate.

**Tip 8: Increase Down Payment**

Higher down payment (20-30% vs 10%) shows commitment and reduces lender risk:

• Faster approval

• Lower interest rate

• Lower monthly payment

• Easier approval for borderline cases

**Tip 9: Get a Guarantor**

If your application is borderline, a guarantor helps:

• Must have good credit (700+)

• Stable income

• Willing to sign guarantee documents

• Can be business partner, spouse, or trusted friend

**Tip 10: Use WhatsApp**

Apply via WhatsApp (+60 17-570 0889) for fastest response. We reply within 1 hour. Submit documents as photos. Get real-time updates.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**How long does excavator financing approval take?**

Approval typically takes 1-3 business days with complete documentation. At Ing Heng Credit, we offer fast approval for qualified applicants. Banks usually take 2-4 weeks, which is why many contractors choose us when they need equipment quickly for projects.

**What credit score is needed for excavator financing?**

No strict minimum credit score required. We evaluate applications individually and approve cases with credit scores from 580+. We have a high approval rate because we look at your entire business profile, not just credit score. Strong project contracts can offset lower credit scores.

**Can I finance used excavators?**

Yes, we finance used excavators up to 10 years old with competitive rates. Most of our clients (70-80%) choose used equipment for better ROI. Banks typically only finance equipment up to 5 years old, but we understand that quality used excavators can serve contractors well for many more years.

**What documents do I need to apply?**

You need: business registration (SSM), IC/passport, 3 months bank statements, quotation/invoice, and business proof (contracts/invoices). That’s minimal documentation compared to banks. We understand many contractors have informal income arrangements, and we work with what you have.

**How much down payment is required?**

Down payment starts from 10-20% of equipment value. Flexible based on your credit profile and business history. Higher down payment (20-30%) can secure better interest rates and faster approval. New contractors may need 20-25% down payment.

**Can I finance excavators for seasonal construction work?**

Yes, we understand construction seasonal patterns. We offer flexible payment plans that align with monsoon slowdowns and peak seasons. You can choose standard fixed payments or seasonal payment plans with lower monsoon payments and higher peak season payments.

**What is the financing tenure for excavators?**

Financing tenure ranges from 36-60 months (3-5 years). Longer tenures available for heavy equipment to keep monthly payments affordable. Choose tenure based on equipment lifespan and your cash flow. Shorter tenure = higher monthly payment but less total interest. Longer tenure = lower monthly payment but more total interest.

**Do you finance excavators for new contractors?**

Yes, we finance new contractors with minimum 1 year in business. Some exceptions for 6+ months if you have strong project contracts. We evaluate based on project contracts and business potential, not just years in business. New contractors may need higher down payment (20-25%) and personal guarantee.

**Can I apply online or must I visit office?**

You can apply three ways: WhatsApp (+60 17-570 0889) which is fastest and most popular, online via our website contact form, or walk-in to Klang office. Most contractors (80%) prefer WhatsApp because they can submit documents as photos and get real-time updates.

**What happens if I miss a payment?**

Contact us immediately if you anticipate missing payment. We offer options: payment deferment (1-2 months), loan restructuring, or temporary reduced payments.
