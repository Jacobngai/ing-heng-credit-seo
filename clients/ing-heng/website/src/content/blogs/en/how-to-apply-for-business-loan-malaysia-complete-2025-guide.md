When you walk into the bank with your carefully prepared business plan, and the loan officer glances at your 18-month-old company registration and says “We typically require 3 years of operating history,” do you feel that sinking sensation in your stomach knowing the RM 150,000 equipment purchase that could triple your revenue is slipping away because of an arbitrary timeline?

You’re not alone. Thousands of Malaysian SME owners face this exact frustration every month - watching profitable opportunities disappear because traditional banks focus more on paperwork than business potential.

## The Reality of Business Loan Applications in Malaysia

Traditional banks reject 70% of SME loan applications. Not because the businesses aren’t viable, but because they don’t fit rigid criteria designed for large corporations, not growing SMEs.

**Common Bank Rejection Reasons:**

• “Your business is too young” (under 3 years)

• “Your cash flow is inconsistent” (seasonal businesses)

• “You don’t have enough collateral” (asset-light businesses)

• “Your industry is too risky” (construction, logistics)

But here’s what banks don’t understand: A 15-month-old logistics company landing government contracts is more creditworthy than a 5-year-old business with declining revenue.

## Why We’re Different: Business Loans That Make Sense

At Ing Heng Credit, we don’t just look at your business age or perfect financial statements. We look at your business potential, your contracts, your growth trajectory, and most importantly - your ability to service the loan.

**Common Financing Purposes We Approve:**

• Equipment purchase (excavators, trucks, machinery)

## Success Stories: Real Malaysian SMEs We’ve Helped

**Ahmad’s Construction Company (Selangor)**
Ahmad needed a RM 180,000 excavator to handle government contracts. Banks rejected him because his company was only 14 months old. We focused on his RM 2.2 million worth of secured contracts and approved his equipment financing with 0% deposit. Today, Ahmad owns three excavators and employs 15 workers.

**Sarah’s Logistics Business (Johor)**
Sarah’s trucking company needed working capital to bridge payment gaps with large clients who pay 60 days after delivery. Banks called her cash flow “inconsistent.” We understood logistics industry payment cycles and provided RM 120,000 working capital. Her revenue doubled within 8 months.

**David’s Manufacturing Expansion (Penang)**
David’s plastic manufacturing business needed RM 250,000 for new injection molding machines. Banks wanted 30% deposit (RM 75,000) which would drain his working capital. Our 0% deposit equipment financing preserved his cash flow while enabling the expansion. Production capacity increased 40%.
