The 5% Down Payment Marketing Trap
          

          


            Banks and equipment dealers advertise "only 5% down payment!" like it's a great deal. Here's what they don't tell you:
          



          
            

### What 5% Really Costs You


            


              **For a RM 300,000 excavator:**

              5% down payment: RM 15,000 upfront

              **The hidden cost:** That RM 15,000 could fund 3 months of operations, hire 1 operator for 6 months, purchase materials for your first project.

              **Bank profit:** They earn interest on YOUR RM 15,000 while you lose working capital.

              **True cost:** Far more than the "low 5%" marketing suggests.
            


          

          
            0% Down Payment: Preserve Capital, Grow Faster
          

          


            Smart contractors understand that working capital is their most valuable asset. Here's the math:
          



          
            
              
                
                  Scenario
                  5% Down
                  Monthly (5%)
                  0% Down
                  Monthly (0%)
                  Capital Preserved
                
              
              
                {downPaymentComparison.map((row) => (
                  
                    {row.scenario}
                    {row.fivePercentDown}
                    {row.monthly5}
                    {row.zeroDown}
                    {row.monthly0}
                    {row.cashFlow}
                  
                ))}
              
            
          

          
            

### The Capital Preservation Advantage


            


              **Example:** You preserve RM 20,000 with 0% down payment.

              **Deploy that capital:**

              - Mobilization for first project: RM 5,000

              - Operator wages (2 months): RM 4,000

              - Fuel and materials: RM 6,000

              - Emergency reserve: RM 5,000

              **Result:** Start working immediately, generate revenue, grow business. With 5% down, that capital is trapped in equipment, delaying your start.
            


          

          
            Approval Rate: Why Banks Reject More Applications
          

          


            Banks approve only 50-60% of equipment financing applications. They demand perfect credit, substantial collateral, and strong financial history.
          



          


            **Our 95% approval rate:** We look beyond credit scores. We evaluate:
          



          

- **Equipment value:** Is the excavator worth the loan amount? (Usually yes)
- **Business viability:** Do you have projects or contracts?
- **Industry experience:** Do you know construction/excavation?
- **Character:** Are you committed to repayment?



          


            **Real story:** Ahmad from Klang needed RM 180,000 for excavator. 3 banks rejected him (limited credit history). We approved 0% down payment in 18 hours. He completed a RM 850,000 government project, earned RM 250,000 profit, and now owns 3 excavators.
          



          
            Speed: 24 Hours vs 2-4 Weeks
          

          


            Time is money in construction. Bank delays cost you projects:
