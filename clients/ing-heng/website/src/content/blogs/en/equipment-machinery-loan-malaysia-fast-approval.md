## Executive Summary: When Speed is Money

**The Situation:**
Your excavator broke down mid-project. Or a "must-have" used crane just appeared on the market at a steal price. You need financing **now**, not in 3 weeks.

**The Solution:**
Fast approval machinery loans from credit companies (like Ing Heng) cut out the red tape. Instead of waiting for bank headquarters approval, you deal directly with decision-makers.

**Key Benefits:**
*   **Speed:** Approval in **24-48 hours**.
*   **Certainty:** Know if you have the funds before committing to a purchase.
*   **Flexibility:** High margin of finance (up to 100%) for strong applicants.

**Verdict:** For time-sensitive deals or emergency replacements, bypass the banks. A fast approval loan secures the asset immediately, keeping your project on track.

## 1. Why Banks Are Too Slow for Contractors

Commercial banks (Maybank, CIMB, Public Bank) are excellent for low interest rates, but terrible for speed. Their process involves:
1.  Branch Manager Review.
2.  Regional Credit Center Analysis.
3.  Headquarters Approval Committee.
4.  Site Valuation Team Scheduling.
5.  Legal Documentation Review.

**Total Time:** 3 - 5 Weeks.
**Result:** The seller sells the machine to someone else. Your project is delayed.

## 2. The "Fast Track" Alternative: Ing Heng Credit

At Ing Heng, we condensed the process. We understand that in construction and logistics, **time is money**.

## 5. How to Ensure Fast Approval (Client Checklist)

Want the absolute fastest service? Prepare these 3 things before contacting us:

1.  **6-Months Bank Statement (PDF):** Download it from your online banking. Screenshots are okay for initial review, but PDFs are faster.
2.  **Photos of the Machine:** Front, Back, Serial Plate (Chassis No.), Hour Meter.
3.  **Quotation:** A simple invoice or WhatsApp message from the seller stating price and model.

> **Tip:** If buying from a private seller (direct owner), get a copy of the Grant (Registration Card) to prove they own it.

## 6. Interest Rates vs. Speed

"Does fast approval mean higher interest?"
**Slightly, but not always.**

*   **Bank Rate:** 3.5% - 5.0% (Flat p.a.)
*   **Ing Heng Rate:** 4.5% - 7.0% (Flat p.a.)

**The Trade-off:**
On a **RM 100,000** loan over **3 years**, the difference in interest is roughly **RM 1,000 - RM 2,000 per year**.
Is saving RM 1,500 worth waiting 4 weeks and risking the machine? For most contractors, the answer is **No**. The machine earns RM 10,000+ a month. Losing a month of work costs far more than the interest difference.

## 7. Case Study: The Urgent Excavator Replacement

**Client:** Mr. Tan, Earthworks Contractor in Selangor.
**Situation:** His main excavator (Sumitomo SH210) engine failed on a critical JKR site. Repair would take 2 weeks. Penalty for delay: RM 5,000/day.
**Action:** Found a used Hitachi ZX200-5G for RM 180,000. Seller wanted cash.
**Bank:** "Submit docs, wait 3 weeks."
**Ing Heng:**
*   **Day 1 (10 AM):** WhatsApped Bank Statements & IC.
*   **Day 1 (2 PM):** Site visit to verify ongoing project.
*   **Day 1 (5 PM):** Approved.
*   **Day 2 (10 AM):** Signed agreement. Supplier paid.
*   **Day 2 (3 PM):** Machine delivered to site.

**Outcome:** Project continued with zero penalty. Mr. Tan paid slightly higher interest but saved RM 50,000 in potential penalties.

## Conclusion

Don't let slow financing kill your business speed. In the fast-moving world of construction and logistics, having a financial partner who moves as fast as you do is a competitive advantage.
