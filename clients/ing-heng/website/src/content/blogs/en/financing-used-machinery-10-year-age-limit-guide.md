## Executive Summary: Does Age Matter?

**The Rule:**
Most Malaysian banks impose a strictly **10-Year Age Limit** on machinery financing.
*   Example: In 2026, banks will only finance machines manufactured in 2016 or later.

**The Exception:**
Ing Heng Credit finances used machinery up to **20 Years Old** (manufactured in 2006).

**Why This Matters:**
A 2012 Kobelco SK200-8 costs **RM 120,000**. A 2020 model costs **RM 280,000**.
Financing the older machine saves you RM 160,000 in debt, but only if you can find a lender.

**Verdict:** Don't let bank policies force you to overspend. Finance the older, reliable machine with us.

## 1. Maximum Financing Age Limit Table (2026)

| Equipment Type | Commercial Bank Limit | Ing Heng Credit Limit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Excavators** | 7 - 10 Years | **20 Years** |
| **Backhoes** | 7 - 10 Years | **15 Years** |
| **Lorries** | 10 - 12 Years | **15 - 18 Years** |
| **Cranes** | 10 - 15 Years | **25 Years** |
| **Forklifts** | 5 - 7 Years | **10 - 12 Years** |
| **CNC Machines** | 5 - 7 Years | **10 - 15 Years** |

## 2. Why Banks Reject Older Machines

It's about risk.
1.  **Valuation Difficulty:** Hard to price a 15-year-old machine accurately.
2.  **Breakdown Risk:** If it breaks, you stop earning, you stop paying.
3.  **Disposal Risk:** Harder to sell if repossessed.

## 3. How We Value Used Machinery

We look at the machine's condition, not just the year.
*   **Engine:** Is it smoking?
*   **Hydraulics:** Any leaks?
*   **Undercarriage:** Worn out?
*   **Hour Meter:** < 10,000 hours vs > 20,000 hours.

**Example:**
A 2008 Hitachi ZX200-3 with a rebuilt engine and new undercarriage is worth more than a neglected 2015 model. We finance the *value*, not the *year*.

## 4. Loan Margin for Old Machines

Expect lower margins for older units.
*   **1 - 5 Years Old:** 90% Margin.
*   **6 - 10 Years Old:** 80% Margin.
*   **11 - 15 Years Old:** 70% Margin.
*   **16 - 20 Years Old:** 50% - 60% Margin.

**Strategy:**
Use the lower margin to negotiate a lower price with the seller ("Cash Buyer" discount).

## 5. Interest Rates for Old vs New

*   **New Machine:** 3.5% - 4.5% p.a.
*   **Used Machine:** 5.0% - 7.5% p.a.

**Is it worth paying 7% interest?**
Yes, because the principal amount is much lower.
*   **New:** RM 300k x 4% = RM 12k interest/year.
*   **Old:** RM 100k x 7% = RM 7k interest/year.
*   **Result:** You pay LESS total interest on the old machine.

## Conclusion

Don't buy a new machine just to get a low interest rate. Buy the machine that makes sense for your contract duration and budget. If that machine is 15 years old, we will back you.
