## Executive Summary: Approval in 3 Steps

**The Barrier:**
Lorry financing involves more than just money. It involves **APAD Permits** (formerly SPAD), **Puspakom Inspection**, and **Road Tax**. Banks reject applications because the permit is not ready or the driver has a bad license record.

**The Solution:**
Our checklist ensures you have everything before you apply.

**Key Requirements:**
1.  **Valid APAD Permit:** Carrier License A or C.
2.  **6 Months Bank Statements:** Showing consistent income.
3.  **Clean Company Record:** No major CTOS issues.

**Verdict:** Preparation prevents rejection. Use this checklist to get approved in 24-48 hours.

## 1. Document Checklist: What to Prepare

Different business types need different documents.

| Document | Sdn Bhd (Pte Ltd) | Enterprise / Sole Prop | Individual (Driver) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity** | Director IC (All) | Owner IC | Applicant IC |
| **Registration** | Form 9, 24, 49, M&A | Form D / E | Driving License (GDL) |
| **Financials** | 6 Months Bank Statement | 6 Months Bank Statement | 3 Months Salary Slip |
| **Permit** | APAD Approval Letter | APAD Approval Letter | Employer Letter |
| **Equipment** | Quotation (Isuzu/Hino) | Quotation | Quotation |

**Note:** For individuals buying a lorry (rare), you need a guarantor and a contract with a logistics company.

## 2. The APAD Permit Hurdles

**You cannot finance a commercial lorry (BDM > 3,500kg) without an APAD Permit.**
*   **Permit A (Carrier):** For transport companies carrying goods for others.
*   **Permit C (Self):** For companies carrying their own goods (e.g., Furniture factory delivering furniture).

**Ing Heng Tip:**
If your permit is "Pending Approval," show us the **acknowledgment receipt** from APAD. We can process the loan approval first ("Conditional Approval") while waiting for the permit.

## 3. Credit Score Requirements (CTOS/CCRIS)

Commercial vehicle loans are stricter on credit history than personal car loans.
*   **CCRIS:** If you have 2+ months late payment on existing loans, banks will reject.
*   **CTOS:** Outstanding telco bills of RM 2,000+ can cause rejection.

**Ing Heng Flexibility:**
We accept 1-2 months late CCRIS if you can explain (e.g., "Client paid late"). We focus on your current bank balance.

## 4. Down Payment & Insurance

Don't forget the upfront costs.
*   **Down Payment:** Typically 10% - 20% (RM 10,000 - RM 20,000).
*   **Insurance:** Commercial vehicle insurance is expensive (RM 3,000 - RM 6,000 per year).
*   **Road Tax:** Based on BDM (Berat Dengan Muatan).

**0% Down Payment:**
Available for companies with 3+ years track record and strong bank statements.

## 5. Age of Lorry

The financing tenure depends on the lorry age.
*   **New:** Max 5 - 7 Years.
*   **Used (1 - 5 Years):** Max 5 Years.
*   **Used (6 - 10 Years):** Max 3 - 4 Years.
*   **Rebuilt/Recond:** Max 4 - 5 Years.

**Important:** We do NOT finance "Sambung Bayar" lorries. The ownership must be legally transferable at JPJ.

## Conclusion

Getting a lorry loan is the first step to expanding your logistics fleet. Don't let paperwork stop your growth. Prepare your documents, clear your small debts, and apply with confidence.
