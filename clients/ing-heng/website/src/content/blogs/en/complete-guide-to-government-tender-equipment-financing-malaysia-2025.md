When Ahmad wins that RM 15 million JKR road construction tender, and the contract requires 3 bulldozers, 5 excavators, and 10 tipper trucks to be on-site within 30 days, does your chest tighten knowing the equipment purchase will cost RM 8 million - money you don’t have sitting in the bank?

When you read the CIDB Class A upgrade requirements listing “minimum RM 2 million equipment value” and you calculate your current fleet is only worth RM 800,000, does that gap feel impossible to bridge?

**You’re not alone.** Government tenders are the biggest opportunities in Malaysian construction - but they require serious equipment backing.

## Why Government Tender Equipment Financing Matters

Malaysian government projects are massive. The **MRT3 project** alone is worth RM 52 billion. **Pan Borneo Highway** is RM 16.5 billion. **ECRL Phase 2** adds another RM 44 billion.

But here’s the challenge: to bid on these projects, you need to prove you have the equipment. And banks? They look at 15-year-old bulldozers and say no.

**We say yes.**

## The Government Tender Equipment Reality

### What Contractors Face:

• **Tender deposits**: 1-3% of project value (RM 150,000 on RM 5M tender)

• **Performance bonds**: 5-10% of contract value

• **Equipment proof**: Must show ownership or guaranteed access

• **CIDB compliance**: Equipment must meet class requirements

• **DOSH certification**: Safety standards for all machinery

### The Cash Flow Trap:

You need equipment to win tenders. But you need won tenders to afford equipment. Banks don’t understand this cycle.

**We do.**

## Equipment Categories for Government Tenders

### **Major Infrastructure Projects:**

**Earthwork &amp; Road Construction:**

• Bulldozers (D6, D7, D8 categories)

• Wheel loaders (966, 980 categories)

• Motor graders for finishing work

• Compactors and rollers

• Water trucks for dust control

**Excavation &amp; Material Handling:**

• Excavators (20-45 ton range)

• Backhoe loaders for precision work

• Long-reach excavators for drainage

• Rock breakers for hard ground

• Crushing and screening plants

**Transportation Fleet:**

• Tipper trucks (10-40 ton capacity)
