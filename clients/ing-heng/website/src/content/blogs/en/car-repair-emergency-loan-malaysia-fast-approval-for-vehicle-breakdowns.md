## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Emergency Loan Questions

**Q: What makes this different from normal car loans?**

A: Emergency car repair loans are processed urgently with relaxed documentation requirements. While normal car loans take 2-4 weeks, emergency loans are approved within hours. We prioritize genuine transportation emergencies over strict credit requirements because losing mobility affects your livelihood immediately.

**Q: Can I apply if my car is very old (15+ years)?**

A: Yes! We finance repairs for cars up to 20 years old if:

• Repair cost is reasonable vs car value

• Car has sentimental or practical value

• You cannot afford replacement vehicle

• Repair extends useful life significantly

Older cars often have lower repair costs and we understand not everyone can afford newer vehicles.

**Q: What if I need to repair multiple things on my car?**

A: Comprehensive repair financing is available for multiple simultaneous problems:

• Engine and transmission issues together

• Accident damage plus mechanical problems

• Major service plus component replacement

• Complete vehicle restoration

We can approve larger loans for comprehensive repairs that restore your car to reliable condition.

### Approval and Credit Questions

**Q: Can I get approved if I already have existing car loan?**

A: Yes! Many customers have existing car loans and need additional financing for unexpected repairs. We evaluate:

• Combined monthly payment affordability

• Current loan payment history

• Total debt service ratio

• Transportation necessity

If you can afford both payments, approval is likely regardless of existing car financing.

**Q: What if my car has been repossessed before?**

A: Previous car repossession doesn’t automatically disqualify you if:

• Current income is stable and sufficient

• Circumstances causing repossession have resolved

• You can demonstrate ability to repay

• Transportation need is genuine

We focus on current financial capacity rather than past difficulties.

**Q: Do I need comprehensive insurance for approval?**

A: Yes, comprehensive car insurance is mandatory for all car repair financing because:

• Protects your investment in repairs

• Protects our interest in the vehicle

• Covers future accidents or damage

• Required by law for financed vehicles

We can recommend affordable insurance providers if needed.

### Loan Terms and Repayment Questions

**Q: Can I add more repairs later if other problems develop?**

A: Additional repair financing is possible through:

• **Top-up loans:** Add to existing loan balance

• **Supplementary loans:** Separate loan for new repairs

• **Refinancing:** Combine all loans for better terms

• **Credit facility:** Pre-approved limit for future repairs

Contact us when additional repairs are needed and we’ll find the best solution.

**Q: What happens if the workshop does poor work?**

A: Protection measures in place:

• Progressive payment based on work completion

• Withhold final payment until satisfactory completion

• Warranty requirements for major repairs

• Legal recourse for defective work

For our recommended workshops, we provide additional protection through monitoring and quality guarantees.

**Q: Can I settle the loan if I sell the car?**

A: Yes, loan settlement is required when selling financed vehicle:

• We provide settlement amount quote

• Buyer can pay directly to us

• Excess proceeds go to you

• Car grant released immediately after full payment

Early settlement rebates apply, saving you interest costs.

### Workshop and Repair Questions

**Q: Can I choose any workshop or must use your recommendations?**

A: You can choose any licensed workshop. However, our recommended workshops offer:

• Pre-negotiated competitive rates

• Quality guarantees on work performed

• Direct payment arrangements

• Established track record

If you prefer your own workshop, we need their business registration and quotation for approval.

**Q: What if repairs cost more than estimated?**

A: Additional financing for cost overruns:

• Top-up approval for genuine additional work

• Verification of extra repairs necessity

• Approval based on remaining loan capacity

• Progressive disbursement for extra work

Workshop must justify additional costs with detailed explanation of extra work required.
