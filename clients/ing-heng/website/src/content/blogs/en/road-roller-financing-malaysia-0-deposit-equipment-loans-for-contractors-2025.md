When you watch that subcontractor’s road roller compacting the asphalt you laid, and you know that RM 12,000 you’re paying him per kilometer could be going straight into your pocket if you owned the roller, does that realization hit your gut like a sledgehammer?

When the road works tender requires “compaction equipment ownership” and you have to decline a RM 800,000 project because you only have pavers but no roller, does your heart sink knowing that missing equipment cost you months of revenue?

When you calculate that renting a road roller costs RM 8,500 per month, and over 5 years you’ll pay RM 510,000 for something you’ll never own, does that frustration burn in your chest like breathing smoke?

**Stop subcontracting your profits. Start controlling your compaction.**

## Your Roller. Your Projects. Your Complete Road Works Revenue.

At Ing Heng Credit, we’ve seen too many road contractors surrender massive profits to equipment rental companies and subcontractors. That’s why we offer **0% deposit road roller financing** with **100% financing options** that complete your road construction capabilities from day one.

No more subcontracting compaction work to others.
No more losing tender opportunities due to missing equipment.
No more rental payments disappearing into other people’s accounts.

**Your road roller. Your complete projects. Your full margins.**

## The Subcontracting Trap That’s Bleeding Your Profits

### The Hidden Cost of Incomplete Equipment

Ahmad runs a road construction company in Seremban. He owns pavers and trucks, but for 6 years he’s been subcontracting all compaction work because he doesn’t own a road roller.

**Annual subcontracting costs: RM 180,000**
**Total over 6 years: RM 1,080,000**

**For that same amount, he could have owned FOUR quality road rollers.**

But subcontracting seemed convenient: “No maintenance worries, no storage needs, just pay per kilometer.”

What the subcontractor didn’t reveal:

• Ahmad lost 40-50% margin on every compaction job

• His company couldn’t bid on complete road projects

• Client payments were delayed waiting for subcontractor coordination

• Quality control was out of his hands

### The Tender Disqualification Problem

**Government and private tenders often require “complete equipment capability.”**

• Need paving AND compaction? “Show us your equipment list.”

• Want the full RM 2.5 million highway project? “Must own all required equipment.”

• Applying for JKR Grade 7 upgrade? “Equipment ownership is mandatory.”

**When you don’t own road rollers, you can’t bid on the biggest, most profitable projects.**

Siti’s company was disqualified from a RM 1.8 million township road project because they only owned pavers. The winning contractor had complete equipment including rollers.

**Missing one piece of equipment = Missing complete project margins.**

### The Quality Control Challenge

Here’s what subcontractors won’t admit: **Their priorities aren’t your priorities.**

• Your timeline vs their schedule conflicts

• Your quality standards vs their “good enough” approach

• Your client relationships vs their equipment availability

• Your reputation vs their maintenance delays

**When someone else controls your compaction quality, they control your project success.**

## 0% Deposit: Your Path to Complete Road Construction

### What 0% Deposit Really Means for Road Rollers

**Zero upfront payment. Finance 100% of the equipment value.**

• Dynapac CC624 costs RM 320,000? Finance RM 320,000.

• CAT CB54 costs RM 280,000? Finance the full amount.

• Want to preserve cash for project working capital? Finance everything.

**This is your competitive edge over contractors still subcontracting compaction work.**

### Why We Offer 0% Deposit When Others Won’t

**Traditional banks require 25-35% deposit because:**

• They don’t understand road construction project cycles

• They fear depreciation on specialized equipment

• They use cookie-cutter criteria for all industries

**We offer 0% deposit because:**

• We understand road construction cash flow patterns

• We know quality road rollers operate reliably for 15+ years

• We assess project potential, not just balance sheets

**40+ years financing road equipment taught us: Complete equipment capability creates complete profits.**

### Real Customer Example: Hassan’s Complete Solution

Hassan needed a used Dynapac CC624 road roller (10 years old) to complete his road construction capabilities.

**Bank Response:** “Rejected. Specialized equipment too risky. Need 35% deposit minimum.”

**Our Response:** “Approved. 0% deposit. 100% financing.”

**Results after 24 months:**

• Stopped subcontracting: Saved RM 15,000/month

• Won complete tenders: 3 major road projects

• Increased margins: From 25% to 45% on road works

• Business growth: From RM 120,000 to RM 280,000 monthly revenue

**Hassan stopped paying others and started profiting completely.**

## We Finance Equipment Banks Consider “Too Specialized”

### 10+ Year Road Rollers: Our Expertise

**Banks say:** “Road rollers too specialized, must be under 5 years old.”

**We say:** “Show us a well-maintained 15-year-old Bomag and we’ll finance it.”

**Why age doesn’t matter to us:**

• Quality road rollers operate 12,000-18,000 hours reliably

• Proper maintenance extends life significantly

• Experienced contractors know equipment condition better than bank analysts

• Some of our most successful clients operate 15+ year old rollers profitably

### Specialized Equipment We’ve Recently Financed

**Dynapac CA512D - 12 years old**

• Bank rejection: “Too specialized for general lending”

• Our approval: 0% deposit, 84 months

• Customer outcome: Contractor completed 15 road projects successfully

**SAKAI SV540D - 14 years old**

• Bank rejection: “Unknown brand, too risky”

• Our approval: 15% deposit, 72 months

• Customer outcome: Perfect compaction record, client retention 100%

**Bomag BW219D - 16 years old**

• Bank rejection: “Beyond standard financing criteria”

• Our approval: 20% deposit, 60 months

• Customer outcome: Equipment still operating daily after 4 years

**The pattern: Banks see specialty risk. We see road construction expertise.**

## Fast Approval When Projects Can’t Wait

**Road construction projects have immovable deadlines.**
