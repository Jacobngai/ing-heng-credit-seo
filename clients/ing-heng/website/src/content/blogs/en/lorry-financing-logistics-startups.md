# Lorry Financing for Logistics Startups: Start Your Business with 0% Deposit

You have the drive. You have the plan. You know logistics can be profitable. But you do not have RM 100,000 cash to buy your first lorry.

This is the reality for aspiring logistics entrepreneurs across Malaysia. The business opportunity is clear. The capital barrier is the problem.

What if you could start your logistics business **without touching your savings?** What if you could get your first lorry with **0% deposit and 100% financing?**

In this guide, you will learn exactly how to finance your first logistics lorry as a startup. No existing track record needed. No massive capital required. Just your determination and the right financing partner.

## Why Startups Need Lorry Financing (Not Cash Purchase)

### Preserve Capital for Operations

When you start a logistics business, you need money for many things:

**Immediate Startup Costs:**
- Lorry insurance (RM 4,000-8,000 annually)
- Road tax and commercial license (RM 2,000-5,000)
- GPS tracking system (RM 800-1,500)
- First month diesel (RM 3,000-5,000)
- Working capital buffer (RM 10,000-20,000)
- Marketing and client acquisition (RM 5,000-10,000)

**Total startup costs beyond the lorry: RM 25,000-50,000**

If you use all your savings to buy a lorry cash (RM 80,000-150,000), you have nothing left for operations. One breakdown, one delayed payment, one slow month - your business is at risk.

**Smart Strategy: Finance the Lorry, Keep Your Cash**

With 0% deposit lorry financing:
- Lorry cost: RM 0 upfront
- Your RM 100,000 savings: Intact for operations
- Monthly payment: RM 3,500-4,500 (affordable from revenue)
- Safety buffer: RM 100,000 for emergencies and growth

**Your capital becomes working capital, not locked in depreciated asset.**

### Leverage Financing for Faster Growth

**Cash Purchase Model:**
- Save RM 100,000 → Buy lorry 1
- Work 2 years, save RM 100,000 → Buy lorry 2
- Work 2 years, save RM 100,000 → Buy lorry 3
- **Timeline: 4+ years to own 3 lorries**

**100% Financing Model:**
- Finance lorry 1 with 0% deposit → Start immediately
- After 6 months (proven track record) → Finance lorry 2
- After 1 year (stable cash flow) → Finance lorry 3
- **Timeline: 1-2 years to operate 3 lorries**

**Finance lets you scale 3x faster than cash purchase.**

### Tax Benefits of Financing (Vs Cash)

**Cash Purchase:**
- Pay RM 100,000 from after-tax money
- Depreciation claim: 20% annually (RM 20,000/year)
- Tax savings: RM 20,000 × 17% = RM 3,400/year

**Lorry Financing:**
- Monthly payment: RM 4,000 (RM 48,000 annually)
- Interest portion is tax-deductible: ~RM 8,000/year
- Tax savings: RM 8,000 × 17% = RM 1,360/year

**Combined with capital preservation, financing makes better financial sense for startups.**

## The 0% Deposit Advantage for New Businesses

- Required deposit: RM 0
- Financed amount: RM 100,000 (100% financing)
- **Cash needed upfront: RM 0**

**You start your business without using your savings.**

### Real Impact: Startup Financial Comparison

**Scenario: Ahmad Wants to Start Logistics Business**

Ahmad has RM 50,000 in savings. He needs a RM 100,000 lorry.

**With Traditional 20% Deposit Requirement:**
- Lorry deposit: RM 20,000 (paid upfront)
- Insurance + road tax: RM 6,000
- First month diesel: RM 4,000
- GPS + minor expenses: RM 2,000
- **Total spent: RM 32,000**
- **Remaining savings: RM 18,000**
- Monthly payment: RM 2,000 (for RM 80,000 loan)

**Risk:** Only RM 18,000 buffer. If business is slow in first 3 months, Ahmad is in trouble.

**With 0% Deposit Financing:**
- Lorry deposit: RM 0
- Insurance + road tax: RM 6,000
- First month diesel: RM 4,000
- GPS + minor expenses: RM 2,000
- **Total spent: RM 12,000**
- **Remaining savings: RM 38,000**
- Monthly payment: RM 2,500 (for RM 100,000 loan)

**Benefit:** RM 38,000 buffer. Ahmad can survive 6-9 months of slow business without stress.

**Extra RM 20,000 in working capital = 6+ months of safety buffer**

### Why This Matters for First-Time Entrepreneurs

**Startup Reality Check:**

Most new logistics businesses face challenges in the first 6 months:
1. **Client Acquisition Takes Time:** 2-3 months to build steady client base
2. **Payment Terms:** Many clients pay 30-60 days after service
3. **Unexpected Costs:** Maintenance, minor accidents, permit fees
4. **Learning Curve:** Route optimization, fuel efficiency, client management

**With 0% deposit, you have breathing room to learn and grow.**

Your savings remain intact to cover:
- Slow months before revenue stabilizes
- Emergency repairs
- Driver salary (when you hire)
- Marketing to acquire clients
- Invoice financing gap (clients pay late)

**Capital preservation is survival insurance for startups.**

**We Understand Startup Realities:**

**Reality 1: You Just Started**

- We say: "Show us your first contract or business plan"

**Reality 2: Cash-Based Income**
- Banks say: "We need formal financial statements"
- We say: "Bank deposits, client contracts, or delivery records work"

**Reality 3: Building Credit History**
- Banks say: "Your credit score is too low (no history)"

### Credit Score Flexibility for New Entrepreneurs

**Acceptable Credit Profiles:**

**Profile 1: Young Entrepreneur (Minimal Credit History)**
- Age: 25-30
- Credit score: 650-700 (limited history, not bad history)

- **Decision:** APPROVED - strong personal financial management

**Minimum acceptable credit score: 580-600 (case-by-case basis)**

**We look at your CURRENT situation and FUTURE potential, not just your PAST credit score.**

## Fast Approval to Start Operations Quickly

### Why Speed Matters for Startups

**Startup Window of Opportunity:**

Contracts do not wait. When a potential client says "Can you start next week?", they mean it.

**Real Scenarios:**
1. **Factory Contract:** "We need 2 lorries for daily delivery starting Feb 1st"
   - If you wait 4 weeks for bank approval, contract goes to competitor
   - If you get approved in 3 days, you secure the contract

2. **E-commerce Partner:** "Our current logistics partner is unreliable, we want to switch"
   - Window to impress: 1-2 weeks
   - Long approval time = missed opportunity

3. **Seasonal Demand:** "CNY rush, need extra lorries for Jan-Feb"
   - Seasonal contracts are short-term windows
   - Slow approval = miss entire season

**For startups, speed = survival.**

### Compare: Bank vs. Our Startup Process

**Traditional Bank (4-6 Weeks Minimum):**

Week 1:
- Visit branch (often rejected at first meeting for being "too new")
- If accepted, submit mountain of documents
- Wait for loan officer to review

Week 2-3:
- Credit assessment
- Business viability study (they question every aspect)
- Request additional documents (often impossible for startups to provide)

Week 4-5:
- Credit committee review (meets once a week)
- If approved, legal documentation preparation
- Insurance arrangement

Week 6:
- Final approval
- Disbursement to supplier
- Collect lorry

**Reality: Many startups are rejected after 2-3 weeks of waiting**

**Our Process (1 Week Total):**

Day 1: Submit application
Day 2: Preliminary approval
Day 3: Final approval
Days 4-7: Collect lorry

**Difference: 5 weeks saved = 5 weeks earlier revenue**

If your monthly revenue is RM 10,000 per lorry, 5 weeks delay = RM 12,500 lost revenue.

**Fast approval literally pays for itself.**
