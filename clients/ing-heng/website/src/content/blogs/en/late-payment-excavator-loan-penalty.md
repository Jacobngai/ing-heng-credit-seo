The True Cost of Missing Even One Payment
          

          


            Most contractors focus on getting approved for their excavator financing. But the real danger comes later—when construction cash flow gets tight and a payment date slips by.
          



          


            **The reality:** Late payment penalties are designed to compound quickly. What starts as a RM500 late fee can balloon into thousands within months, putting your excavator—and your business—at risk.
          



          
            
              Typical Late Payment Penalties (Malaysia)
            
            

- 1
                
                  **Late Payment Charge**
                  

1-2% of outstanding amount, charged monthly on overdue balance


                
- 2
                
                  **Compound Interest**
                  

Interest continues accumulating on the original amount PLUS late fees


                
- 3
                
                  **Legal & Administrative Fees**
                  

RM500-2,000 for demand letters, notices, and processing


                
- 4
                
                  **Credit Bureau Reporting**
                  

Default reported to CCRIS/CTOS, affecting future financing for 5-7 years


                


          

          


            For a RM5,000 monthly installment, missing payment for 3 months could cost you an additional **RM1,500-3,000** in penalties alone—before considering legal fees or repossession costs.
          



          
            Repossession Timeline: What Actually Happens
          

          


            Many contractors believe repossession only happens after many months of non-payment. The truth: the process starts alarmingly fast.
          



          
            
              
                
                  Day 1
                
              
              
                

#### Payment Missed


                

Late payment fee applied. Your account marked as "in arrears." First reminder notice sent.


              
            
            
              
                
                  Day 30
                
              
              
                

#### Formal Demand Letter


                

Legal demand letter issued. Additional administrative fees charged. Credit bureau notified of delinquency.


              
            
            
              
                
                  Day 60-90
                
              
              
                

#### Default Notice


                

Formal default notice issued. You have 14 days to remedy default. Repossession process initiated if unresolved.


              
            
            
              
                
                  Day 90+
                
              
              
                

#### Repossession & Auction


                

Excavator seized. Sold at auction (often below market value). You still owe the deficiency balance plus all fees.


              
            
          

          


            **The worst part:** After repossession and auction, you'll likely still owe money (the "deficiency balance"). If your excavator sells for RM150,000 but you owe RM200,000, you're legally obligated to pay the RM50,000 difference—plus all repossession fees.
          



          
            Smart Installment Structuring: Protect Your Business
          

          


            The key to avoiding late payment penalties is structuring your excavator loan correctly from day one. Many contractors overestimate their consistent cash flow and underestimate the impact of construction cycles.
          



          
            
              The 30% Rule: Your Safety Margin
            
            


              Your monthly excavator installment should **never exceed 30% of your average monthly revenue** from that machine.
            


            
              


                **Example:**

                Excavator earns RM15,000/month average revenue

                Maximum installment: RM15,000 × 30% = RM4,500/month
              


            
            


              If your RM5,000/month installment leaves you no buffer, you're one delayed client payment away from default.
            


          

          
            Seasonal Planning: Monsoon & Holiday Slowdowns
          

          


            Malaysian construction has predictable slow periods every year:
          



          

- 
                


              
              **Monsoon season (Nov-Feb)** - Heavy rainfall, flooding, project delays
- 
                
              
              **Chinese New Year (Jan/Feb)** - 2-4 week shutdown period
- 
                
              
              **Hari Raya (variable dates)** - 1-2 week slowdown



          
            
              Build 3-6 Months of Reserve
            
            
              Before committing to an excavator loan, save enough cash to cover **3-6 months of installments**. This is your emergency fund for slow periods. When monsoon season hits and projects pause, you won't miss payments—and you won't panic when client invoices are delayed.
            


          

          
            Restructuring: Better Than Default
          

          


            If you're already struggling with payments, **contact your financier immediately**. Do not wait until you've missed multiple payments.
          



          


            At Ing Heng Credit, we prefer to find workable solutions rather than repossess assets. We've helped contractors through:
          



          

- 
                


              
              **Extending loan tenure** - Reduces monthly payment to manageable levels
- 
                
              
              **Payment holidays** - Temporary 1-3 month payment suspension for emergencies
- 
                
              
              **Refinancing** - Replace existing loan with better terms based on improved equity
- 
                
              
              **Partial payment arrangements** - Reduced payments during hardship with catch-up later



          
            **Key point:** We can only help if you contact us *before* you're in default. Once repossession proceedings start, options become extremely limited.
