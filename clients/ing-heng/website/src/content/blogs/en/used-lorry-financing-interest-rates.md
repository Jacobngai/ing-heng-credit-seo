## The Used Lorry Dilemma: Lower Price, Higher Rates



      

You're starting a logistics business or expanding your fleet. You see two options:



      

**New 5-Ton Lorry:** RM200,000, 5% financing rate
      
**Used 5-Ton Lorry (2018 model, 6 years old):** RM100,000, 7% financing rate



      

The used lorry costs half as much—but carries 2% higher interest. Is it worth it?



      

The answer isn't as simple as comparing interest rates. You need to calculate total cost of ownership, remaining useful life, and revenue potential. For many logistics companies, used lorries with higher rates are financially superior to new lorries with lower rates.



      

## Why Used Lorry Rates Are Higher



      

### Risk Factors for Lenders



      

Banks and finance companies charge higher rates for used lorries due to:



      

- **Uncertain Remaining Lifespan:** A new lorry lasts 10-15 years. A 6-year-old lorry might last 4-9 more years (uncertain)
- **Higher Maintenance Risk:** Older lorries need more repairs. If you default, the repossessed asset may have degraded value
- **Resale Value Risk:** Used lorries depreciate faster. If repossessed, recovery value is lower
- **Technology Obsolescence:** Older lorries may not meet emerging emissions or safety standards



      

### Typical Rate Structure



      

**New Lorry Financing:** 4-6% flat per annum
      
**Used Lorry (Under 5 years old):** 5-7% flat per annum
      
**Used Lorry (5-10 years old):** 7-9% flat per annum
      
**Used Lorry (10+ years old):** 10-15% flat per annum (if financing available at all)



      

## The Total Cost Analysis: Beyond Interest Rates



      

### Scenario: 5-Year Financing Comparison



      

**Option A: New Lorry**
      
• Purchase price: RM200,000
      
• Down payment (20%): RM40,000
      
• Financing amount: RM160,000
      
• Interest rate: 5% flat per annum
      
• Term: 5 years (60 months)



      

**Monthly Installment:** ~RM3,400
      
**Total Payments:** RM204,000
      **Total Interest:** RM44,000
      
**Total Cost:** RM244,000 (including RM40,000 down payment)



      

**Option B: Used Lorry (6 Years Old)**
      
• Purchase price: RM100,000
      
• Down payment (0% with Ing Heng Credit): RM0
      
• Financing amount: RM100,000
      
• Interest rate: 7% flat per annum
      
• Term: 5 years (60 months)



      

**Monthly Installment:** ~RM2,100
      
**Total Payments:** RM126,000
      
**Total Interest:** RM26,000
      
**Total Cost:** RM126,000 (0% down payment)



      

### Cost Comparison Over 5 Years



      

**New Lorry Total Cost:** RM244,000
      
**Used Lorry Total Cost:** RM126,000
      
**Savings with Used:** RM118,000 (48% lower total cost)



      

**But:** This analysis doesn't account for:
      
• Remaining useful life difference
      
• Maintenance cost differences
      
• Resale value at end of financing



      

## The Remaining Life Factor: When Higher Rates Make Sense



      

### Age-Based Remaining Life



      

**New Lorry (0 years):** 10-12 years remaining life
      
**Used Lorry (5 years old):** 5-7 years remaining life
      
**Used Lorry (8 years old):** 2-4 years remaining life



      

### Cost-Per-Year Analysis



      

This is where used lorries often shine:



      

**New Lorry Cost per Year:**
      
• Total cost: RM244,000 ÷ 10 years = RM24,400/year
      
• Annual depreciation: RM20,000/year



      

**Used Lorry (6 years old) Cost per Year:**
      
• Total cost: RM126,000 ÷ 5 years = RM25,200/year
      
• Annual depreciation: RM20,000/year (already depreciated significantly)



      

**Result:** Similar annual costs, but used lorry requires 50% less upfront capital and generates revenue immediately.



      

## Maintenance Cost Reality: What to Expect



      

### Maintenance Cost Comparison



      

**New Lorry (Years 1-3):**
      
• Routine maintenance: RM8,000-RM12,000/year
      
• Warranty coverage: Most repairs covered
      
**Annual Out-of-Pocket:** RM8,000-RM12,000



      

**Used Lorry (6-8 Years Old, Years 1-3 of Ownership):**
      
• Routine maintenance: RM12,000-RM18,000/year
      
• Major repairs: RM8,000-RM15,000/year average
      
• No warranty coverage
      
**Annual Out-of-Pocket:** RM20,000-RM33,000



      

**Maintenance Cost Difference:** RM12,000-RM21,000 higher annually for used lorry



      

**Net Calculation:**
      
• Used lorry saves RM118,000 in purchase cost
      
• Used lorry costs RM15,000-30,000 more in maintenance over 5 years
      
**Net Savings:** RM88,000-RM103,000 despite higher maintenance



      

## When Higher Rates Are Worth It



      

### Scenario 1: Limited Capital, High Revenue Potential



      

**Situation:** Starting logistics business, RM50,000 capital available



      

**If Buy New:**
      
• Need RM40,000 down payment
      
• Remaining RM10,000 insufficient for operations (fuel, driver, insurance)
      
• Must borrow additional capital or delay operations



      

**If Buy Used with 0% Down:**
      
• No down payment required
      
• Full RM50,000 available for operations
      
• Immediate revenue generation
      
• Higher financing rate offsets by earlier profitability



      

### Scenario 2: Proving Business Model



      

**Situation:** New logistics route, uncertain long-term demand



      

**Strategy:** Buy used lorry at 50% cost:
      
• If route succeeds: Upgrade to new lorries in 2-3 years
      
• If route fails: Easier to sell used lorry (lower capital loss)
      
• Higher rate on RM100,000 is less risky than lower rate on RM200,000 when success uncertain



      

### Scenario 3: Short-Term Contract (2-3 Years)



      

**Situation:** 3-year port haulage contract secured



      

**Strategy:** Buy used lorry:
      
• Contract pays RM180,000 annually
      
• Used lorry cost: RM100,000 (financed at 8%)
      
• Annual financing cost: RM12,000
      
• Net profit: RM168,000/year
      
• Contract ends: Sell lorry for RM60,000-RM80,000 (still has value)
      
**ROI:** Used lorry generates strong profit despite higher rate



      

## Banks vs Ing Heng Credit: Used Lorry Financing



      

### Bank Position on Used Lorries



      

Most Malaysian banks:
      
• Won't finance lorries older than 7-10 years
      
• Require 20-30% down payment even for younger used lorries
      
• May reject lorries with high mileage (200,000+ km)
      
• Prefer new lorries for approved financing



      

### Ing Heng Credit Position



      

We finance used lorries that banks reject:
      
• Lorries up to 10 years old (verified condition)
      
• 0% down payment available (preserves working capital)
      
• High-mileage lorries considered (if well-maintained)
      
• Fast approval (24-48 hours) for time-sensitive purchases



      

### Why We Can Finance Used Lorries



      

Our 40+ years in equipment financing teaches us:
      
• Well-maintained used lorries are reliable assets
      
• Lorry age matters less than maintenance history
      
• Logistics companies maintain fleets (not like individual car owners)
      
• Commercial use means lorries are earning assets, not depreciating toys



      

## Inspection Checklist: Before Financing Used Lorries



      

### Engine and Mechanical



      

- Compression test (engine health verification)
- Oil analysis (check for contaminants, wear metals)
- Turbocharger condition (critical for modern lorries)
- Clutch and gearbox operation (smooth engagement, no slipping)
- Differential operation (no unusual noises or vibrations)



      

### Chassis and Body



      

- Rust inspection (structural integrity, especially frame rails)
- Accident history (check with PUSPAKOM, paint overspray indicates repairs)
- Tire condition (even wear, appropriate tread depth)
- Suspension performance (no sagging, worn bushings)
- Brake system performance (stopping distance, pad/lining thickness)



      

### Documentation



      

- Service history (available? complete?)
- Previous ownership (single owner better than multiple)
- PUSPAKOM inspection report (current)
- JPJ registration (clean title, not cloned)
- APAD permit (if applicable, transferable)



      

## Real-World Used Lorry Success Stories



      

### Selangor Start-Up Fleet



      

"Starting logistics business with RM80,000 capital. Needed 2 lorries immediately. Banks required 30% down payment on new lorries (RM120,000). Would drain all capital. Ing Heng financed 2 used 2017 lorries (7 years old, well-maintained) at 0% down. Rate was 8% (vs 5% for new), but lower purchase price made total cost lower. 5 years later, both lorries still running strong, business profitable, upgraded to newer units while maintaining original used lorries as backup."


      

*— R. Kumararaj, Logistics Director*



      

### Johor Contract Haulage



      

"Won 3-year port haulage contract. Needed 3 lorries fast. New lorries: RM600,000, 20% down required (RM120,000). Budget constrained. Bought 3 used 2016 lorries at RM240,000 total. Financed at 8% interest, 0% down. Contract revenue: RM540,000/year. Financing cost: RM76,800/year over 5 years = RM384,000 total. Net profit over 5 years: RM1,180,000 after all costs. Used lorries generated strong ROI despite higher rates."


      

*— Ahmad Zaki, Operations Manager*



      

## Decision Framework: New vs Used Calculator



      

### Step 1: Calculate Total Financing Cost



      

**New:** (Purchase price - down payment) × interest rate × term + down payment
      
**Used:** Purchase price × interest rate × term + 0 down payment (if available)



      

### Step 2: Add Maintenance Costs



      

Add expected maintenance over financing term:
      
• New: RM10,000/year × term
      
• Used: RM25,000/year × term



      

### Step 3: Add Revenue Loss from Downtime



      

Consider:
      
• New lorry downtime: 5-10 days/year
      
• Used lorry downtime: 15-25 days/year
      
• Daily revenue loss: RM1,500-RM3,000



      

### Step 4: Compare Total Costs



      

Choose option with lower total cost (purchase + financing + maintenance + downtime), not just lower interest rate.



      

## The Bottom Line: Used Lorries Win When Capital is Limited



      

The used lorry financing rate premium (2-4% higher) is worth it when:



      

- **Capital Preservation:** 0% down payment preserves cash for operations
- **Fleet Expansion:** Buy 2-3 used lorries for price of 1 new lorry
- **Proving Demand:** Test routes with used equipment before committing to new
- **Short-Term Contracts:** Match equipment to contract duration



      

Banks avoid used lorry financing. We specialize in it. With 40+ years of equipment financing experience, we assess used lorries based on condition, not just age.



      

Don't let higher rates deter you from used lorry opportunities. The total cost is often lower, especially with 0% down payment preserving your working capital.
