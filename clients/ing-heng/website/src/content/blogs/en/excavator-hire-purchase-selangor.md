## Why Selangor Contractors Choose Hire Purchase

### 1. Own the Excavator from Day One

Unlike rental, hire purchase gives you ownership rights immediately. You can:
- Use the excavator for any project
- Work without daily rental charges
- Build company assets
- Deduct installments as business expenses

### 2. Better Cash Flow Management

Spread the excavator cost over 36-60 months. This helps with:
- **Monsoon season slowdowns** (Nov-Feb)
- **Project payment delays**
- **Maintaining working capital**
- **Seasonal cash flow fluctuations**

### 3. Fast Approval for Urgent Projects

Banks take 2-4 weeks. We provide much faster responses. This matters when:
- You win a tender requiring owned equipment
- A rental excavator breaks down mid-project
- You need to start work immediately
- Your competitor is bidding for the same project

### 4. High Approval Rates

Our 95% approval rate helps contractors who:
- Have credit scores 580+ (banks require 700+)
- Run cash-based businesses
- Are new companies (1-2 years old)
- Have seasonal income patterns
