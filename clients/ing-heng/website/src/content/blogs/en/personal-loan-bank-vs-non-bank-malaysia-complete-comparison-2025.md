**Requirements for Switching:**

• Improved credit score since original application

• Stable employment and income

• Good payment history on existing loan

• Meet new lender’s eligibility criteria

**Process:**

• Apply for new loan with bank

• Bank pays off your existing non-bank loan

• You continue payments with bank at lower rate

**Costs to Consider:**

**Best Timing:** After 1-2 years of consistent payments to improve credit profile.

**Q: What happens if I cannot pay my loan installment on time?**

A: Consequences vary between bank and non-bank lenders:

**Bank Response:**

• Grace period: Usually 7-10 days before penalty

• Late payment fee: RM50-RM200 per incident

• Interest on overdue amount: 1-2% per month additional

• Credit bureau reporting: After 30 days late

• Legal action: Typically after 3-6 months default

**Non-Bank Response:**

• Grace period: Often more flexible, case-by-case

• Late payment fee: 1-2% of overdue amount per month

• Personal contact: More likely to call and negotiate

**Proactive Steps:**

• Contact lender immediately when you know payment will be late

• Explain circumstances and request payment arrangement

• Propose revised payment schedule if temporary difficulty

• Consider family assistance to avoid default record

**Q: Is it legal for non-bank lenders to charge higher interest rates than banks?**

A: Yes, it’s completely legal within regulated limits:

**Legal Framework:**

• Maximum effective interest rate: 18% per annum

• Regulated by Bank Negara Malaysia and other authorities

• Different business models justify different pricing

**Why Non-Banks Charge More:**

• Higher risk customers (bad credit, irregular income)

• Smaller scale of operations (higher overhead per loan)

• More personalized service and flexibility

• Quick approval processes cost more to provide

• Higher default rates require higher margins

**Rate Calculation:**

• Must be quoted as effective annual rate

• Includes all costs and fees

• Cannot use misleading flat rate quotations

• Must provide clear payment schedules

**Consumer Protection:**

• Right to clear disclosure of all costs

• Cooling-off period for certain loans

• Complaint mechanisms available

• Legal recourse for violations

**Q: Do banks and non-bank lenders report to the same credit bureaus?**

A: Yes, most licensed lenders report to the same bureaus:

• ExpressCredit - Private credit bureau

**Reporting Requirements:**

• All banks must report to CCRIS monthly

• Licensed moneylenders must report to CCRIS

• Some non-bank lenders also report to private bureaus

• Payment history affects credit score equally

**Impact on Credit Score:**

• Loan applications show as inquiries on credit report

• Credit utilization affects score calculations

**Building Credit:**

• Non-bank loans can help build positive credit history

• Consistent payments demonstrate creditworthiness

• May qualify for bank products after good payment record

• Consider non-bank as stepping stone to better credit

**Q: Can I have both bank and non-bank personal loans at the same time?**

A: Yes, but with important considerations:

**Legal Perspective:**

• No law prevents multiple personal loans

• Each lender evaluates based on total debt obligations

• Must disclose existing loans on applications

**Practical Considerations:**

• Total debt service ratio becomes crucial (should stay under 60-70%)

• Each new application appears on credit report

• Monthly payment capacity is key factor

• Income must support all loan obligations

**Approval Factors:**

• Combined monthly payments vs income

• Payment history on existing loans

• Purpose and necessity of additional borrowing

• Stability of income source

**Management Tips:**

• Keep track of all payment dates

• Set up automatic payments where possible

• Budget carefully for combined obligations

• Consider debt consolidation if payments become difficult

**Strategic Approach:**

• Use bank loan for major purchases (lower cost)
