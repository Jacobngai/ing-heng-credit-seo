## Executive Summary: Getting Your Equipment Loan Approved

**The Challenge:**
Applying for a business loan in Malaysia can be frustrating. Banks often demand audited accounts, high down payments (20-30%), and take weeks to process. One small mistake in your application can lead to rejection.

**The Solution:**
Preparation is key. By understanding what lenders look for—Capacity, Character, Capital, and Collateral—you can maximize your chances.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Documentation:** Organize your 6-months bank statements and SSM.
*   **Credit Score:** Clear small CTOS debts (Telco bills) before applying.
*   **Asset Value:** Choose popular brands (Toyota, Caterpillar, Isuzu) for better Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios.
*   **Fast Track:** Ing Heng Credit offers **24-48 hour approval** with minimal documents.

**Verdict:** If you prepare the right documents and choose the right lender, getting approved for an excavator, lorry, or machine is straightforward.

## 1. Why Equipment Loans Get Rejected (And How to Fix It)

Rejection happens for specific reasons. Understanding them is the first step to approval.

### Common Rejection Reasons:
1.  **Poor Cash Flow:**
    *   *The Problem:* Bank account balance frequently hits RM 0 or negative.
    *   *The Fix:* Maintain an average balance of at least RM 5,000 - RM 10,000. Don't drain the account immediately after receiving payment.

2.  **Bad Credit History (CCRIS/CTOS):**
    *   *The Problem:* Late payments on existing loans (Hire Purchase, Housing Loan) or unpaid telco bills.
    *   *The Fix:* Clear outstanding arrears. For small CTOS debts (< RM 1,000), pay them off immediately and get a "Release Letter."
    *   *The Ing Heng Advantage:* We are more flexible. We can overlook 1-2 months of late payment if you have a valid reason (e.g., late project payment).

3.  **Weak Collateral Value:**
    *   *The Problem:* Buying an obscure brand or very old machine (15+ years).
    *   *The Fix:* Stick to mainstream brands. If buying old equipment, ensure it's in good working condition. Ing Heng finances equipment up to **20 years old**, unlike most banks.

4.  **Incomplete Documentation:**
    *   *The Problem:* Missing pages in bank statements or expired SSM.
    *   *The Fix:* Use the checklist below.

## 2. Document Checklist: What You Need

Whether you are a Sole Proprietorship or a Sdn Bhd, having these documents ready speeds up the process by 50%.

| Document Type | Sole Proprietorship / Partnership | Sdn Bhd (Private Limited) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Registration** | Form D / E (SSM) | Form 9, 24, 49, M&A (SSM) |
| **Identity** | Owner's IC (Front & Back) | All Directors' ICs |
| **Financials** | 6 Months Company Bank Statements | 6 Months Company Bank Statements |

| **Site Photos** | Photo of Office / Yard / Site | Photo of Office / Factory / Site |

> **Pro Tip:** If you are buying a **used machine** from a direct owner, get a copy of the Registration Card (Grant) to prove ownership.

## 3. The 4 Steps to Fast Approval

Follow this roadmap to get your machine on site within 5 days.

### Step 1: Pre-Qualify Yourself
Check your own CTOS report.
*   **Score > 700:** Excellent. You qualify for **0% Down Payment**.
*   **Score 600-699:** Good. Standard terms apply.
*   **Score < 600:** Fair. Be prepared to explain the low score or offer a higher down payment (10-20%).

### Step 2: Choose the Right Equipment
Select a machine that holds value.
*   **High Resale Value:** Toyota Forklift, Kobelco Excavator, Hino Lorry.
*   **Lower Resale Value:** Specialized custom machinery, obscure Chinese brands.
*   *Strategy:* If your credit is weak, choose a high-value asset. The lender is more likely to approve because the collateral is strong.

### Step 3: Submit Application to Ing Heng Credit
Why us? Because we process applications in **24-48 hours**.
*   WhatsApp your documents to **+60 17-570 0889**.
*   No need to visit a branch.
*   We will conduct a quick site visit to verify your business existence.

### Step 4: Accept the Offer Letter (LO)
Review the terms:
*   **Margin of Finance:** 80%? 90%? Or 100%?
*   **Interest Rate:** Flat rate vs. Reducing balance.
*   **Tenure:** 3 years? 5 years?
*   **Installment:** Is it manageable?

Sign the LO and pay the processing fee (if any). The fund will be disbursed directly to the supplier.

## 4. Insider Tips for Tough Cases

What if your application is borderline? Here are strategies we've seen work for hundreds of clients:

### Strategy A: Use a Guarantor
If your company is new (< 1 year), add a strong guarantor.
*   Ideally a Director with good personal income.
*   Or a related company with a strong track record.

### Strategy B: Higher Down Payment
Offering a higher deposit (e.g., 30%) reduces the lender's risk significantly.
*   It shows commitment.
*   It lowers the loan amount, making approval easier.

### Strategy C: Show Future Contracts
If you just won a big project (e.g., JKR road work), show the **Letter of Award (LOA)**.
*   Lenders love "project financing." It proves you have a guaranteed source of repayment.
