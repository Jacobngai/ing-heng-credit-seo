## Port Klang Logistics Market Demand

### Current Industry Situation

**High demand for prime movers:**
- Port Klang container volume growing 5-7% annually
- Shortage of qualified transport operators
- Shipping lines prefer owned equipment (reliability)
- E-commerce boom driving import demand
- Manufacturing exports increasing

**Typical contract rates:**
- **Port to Shah Alam depot:** RM180-220 per container
- **Port to Nilai/Seremban:** RM250-300 per container
- **Port to Ipoh:** RM450-550 per container
- **Port to Singapore:** RM1,200-1,500 per container
- **Monthly contract rates:** RM25,000-40,000 per prime mover

**Average revenue per prime mover:**
- 2-3 trips per day (local hauling)
- RM400-600 daily revenue
- RM10,000-15,000 monthly revenue per unit
- 4-5 prime movers = RM40,000-75,000 monthly revenue

### ROI Calculation Example

**Scenario: 1 Scania R450 Prime Mover**

**Equipment cost:** RM500,000 (new)
**Financing:** 0% deposit, RM500,000 loan at 8% p.a., 60 months
**Monthly payment:** RM10,135

**Monthly revenue:**
- 2.5 trips per day × 25 working days = 62.5 trips
- Average RM200 per trip = RM12,500 gross revenue

**Monthly costs:**
- Loan payment: RM10,135
- Diesel: RM3,500
- Maintenance: RM800
- Insurance: RM600
- Driver salary: RM3,500
- Road tax: RM150
- **Total costs:** RM18,685

**Net profit:** RM12,500 - RM18,685 = **Break-even in first year**

**Year 2 onwards (after optimizing routes):**
- 3 trips per day = 75 trips × RM200 = RM15,000 revenue
- Same costs: RM18,685
- **Net profit improves to RM-3,685** (still building efficiency)

**Year 3 onwards (established routes):**
- 3 trips × RM220 (better rates) = RM16,500 revenue
- **Profitable operations with asset building**

**After 5 years:**
- Own prime mover outright (RM0 loan payment)
- Monthly costs drop to RM8,550
- Revenue: RM16,500+
- **Monthly profit: RM7,950+**
- Resale value: RM200,000-250,000 (well-maintained unit)

**With 0% deposit financing:**
- Preserve RM500,000 working capital
- Use cash for operations, fuel, driver salaries
- Build fleet faster (buy 2nd unit sooner)
- Better cash flow management
