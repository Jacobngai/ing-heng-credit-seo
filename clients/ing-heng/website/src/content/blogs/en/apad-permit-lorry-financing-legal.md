## The APAD Permit: Non-Negotiable for Lorry Operations



      

You've financed your lorry. You have insurance and road tax. You're ready to start operations.



      

Then you get pulled over at a JPJ checkpoint. Officer asks: "Where's your APAD permit?"



      

You don't have one.



      

**Result:** Compound fine RM500-RM2,000. Lorry impounded. Business shut down until permit obtained.



      

APAD (Agensi Kualiti dan Keselamatan Jalan Raya) permits are mandatory for all commercial lorries in Malaysia. Operating without one isn't just illegal—it's business suicide.

## Real-World APAD Permit Stories



      

### New Fleet Startup



      

\"Started logistics business with 3 lorries. Financed with 0% down—preserved RM60,000 capital. Thought could operate immediately. First day, pulled over by JPJ—no APAD permits. Lorries impounded. RM5,000 fines. Lost RM15,000 revenue while lorries impounded. Applied for permits, took 2 weeks. If had known about APAD requirement, would have included in financing. Now always ensure permits bundled. Ing Heng helped with next 5 lorries—all permits included, no more legal issues.\"


      

*— Ahmad Zaki, Director*



      

### Permit Renewal Oversight



      

\"Operated 8 lorries for 5 years. APAD permits expired January—missed renewal date due to peak season workload. February, 2 lorries stopped for JPJ inspection, permits expired. Compound RM3,000. Lorries impounded 1 week each. Lost RM25,000 revenue. Client delays. Ing Heng refinanced fleet with permits bundled—monthly payment higher but renewals automatic. Never miss renewal again. 0% down preserved RM160,000 used for permit renewals and operations while refinancing processed.\"


      

*— Zainal Abidin, Fleet Manager*



      

## Planning Your APAD Permit Strategy



      

### Step 1: Determine Permit Requirements



      

For each lorry:
      
• Permit type needed (GVL, PSV, International)
      
• Permit duration (1-2 years)
      
• Required documentation
      
• Application fees



      

### Step 2: Calculate Permit Budget



      

Fleet-wide:
      
• Total permit costs annually
      
• Renewal months (not all lorries renew same month)
      
• Cash flow impact during renewal months



      

### Step 3: Bundle in Financing



      

When financing lorries:
      
• Include permit application fees
      
• Include first year permit costs
      
• Consider multi-year bundling
      
• Ensure automatic renewal provision



      

### Step 4: Track Renewal Dates



      

Maintain schedule:
      
• Expiration date for each permit
      
• Renewal application deadlines
      
• Documentation update requirements
      
• JPJ inspection schedules



      

## The Bottom Line: Legal Operations Aren't Optional



      

APAD permits aren't bureaucratic red tape—they're legal requirements. Operating without permits risks:



      

- **Fines:** RM500-RM5,000 per offense
- **Impoundment:** Lorries seized, business halted
- **Client Loss:** Contracts cancelled due to unreliability
- **Financing Default:** No revenue = missed payments = repossession



      

Bundle APAD permits in your lorry financing. 0% down payment preserves cash for other needs. Automatic renewals prevent lapses.



      

Don't let permit compliance shut down your logistics business. Finance legally and operate confidently.
