# Complete Guide to Lorry Loans in Malaysia 2025: Fast Approval & Competitive Rates

Running a logistics or transport business in Malaysia means owning your own lorry is key to success. But buying a lorry requires a large amount of capital. This is why **lorry loans** have become the preferred solution for many logistics business owners.

Whether you are a new entrepreneur or an established owner looking to expand your fleet, understanding the detailed lorry loan process can help you make the best decisions.

This article will explain all the details about lorry loans in Malaysia, including application processes, required documents, eligibility requirements, and practical advice.

## Why Do You Need a Lorry Loan?

### Build Your Own Fleet

Renting a lorry costs up to RM2,000-3,500 per month. Over the long term, this expense can buy several lorries.

By financing a lorry purchase, you can:
- **Own an asset**: The lorry belongs to you and can be resold or refinanced
- **Reduce costs**: Monthly payments are usually cheaper than rental
- **Expand business**: Accept more contracts and earn more income
- **Build credit**: On-time payments can build a good credit record

### Seize Business Opportunities

When you receive large orders or transport contracts, you need to increase your lorries immediately. If you wait for bank approval (usually takes 2-4 weeks), you might lose the contract.

**Fast approval lorry loans** can get you funding within 1-3 business days, allowing you to seize opportunities.

### Preserve Cash Flow

If you pay for the lorry in full, your company's cash flow will be affected. If customers delay payment, you might face cash shortages.

Through financing, you can:
- Preserve cash for daily expenses (fuel, repairs, salaries)
- Handle emergencies (vehicle breakdowns, urgent repairs)
- Invest in other business opportunities
