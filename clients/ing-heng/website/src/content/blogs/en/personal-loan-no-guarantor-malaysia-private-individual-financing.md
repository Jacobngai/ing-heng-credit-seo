When the bank officer slides the guarantor form across the desk and says “We’ll need two working guarantors for this RM 30,000 personal loan,” do you feel that sinking feeling in your stomach knowing you have to involve family or friends in your private financial matters?

That moment when you realize asking someone to sign as your guarantor means:

• Exposing your financial situation to others

• Creating potential strain in relationships

• Making others legally responsible for your debt

• Risking friendships over money matters

It feels uncomfortable because financial independence should be… independent.

## Why Banks Demand Guarantors (And Why We Don’t)

Traditional banks see guarantors as risk insurance. If you can’t pay, they have someone else to chase. It’s their way of reducing risk without properly assessing your individual capacity.

**What Banks Typically Demand:**

• Two working guarantors with stable income

• Guarantors must be relatives or close friends

• Guarantors become legally liable for full debt amount

• Joint and several liability agreements

• Guarantors’ credit scores affected by your loan

• Annual income verification for all guarantors

**The Hidden Problems with Guarantor Requirements:**
When you involve guarantors, you’re not just getting a loan - you’re potentially damaging relationships. Late payments affect their credit. Defaults become their responsibility. Family dinners become awkward when money is involved.

## Our Individual Assessment Approach

At Ing Heng Credit, we believe your personal loan should remain personal. We assess YOU as an individual - your income, your stability, your circumstances - without involving anyone else.
