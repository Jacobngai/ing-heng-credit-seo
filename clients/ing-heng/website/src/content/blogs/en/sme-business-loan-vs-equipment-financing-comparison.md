## Executive Summary: Cash or Collateral?

**The Difference:**
*   **SME Business Loan (Unsecured):** Based on your company's creditworthiness. No collateral needed. Higher interest.
*   **Equipment Financing (Secured):** Based on the asset (machine) value. Lower interest. Easier approval.

**Key Insight:**
If you need to buy machinery, always choose **Equipment Financing**. It's cheaper (4-5% vs 7-9%) and preserves your credit line for working capital.

**Verdict:** Use SME Loans for salaries/rent. Use Equipment Financing for assets.

## 1. Feature Comparison Table

| Feature | SME Business Loan (Clean Loan) | Equipment Financing (Hire Purchase) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Collateral Required** | None (Director Guarantee) | The Equipment Itself |
| **Interest Rate** | **6.5% - 12.0% p.a.** | **3.5% - 6.0% p.a.** |
| **Loan Amount** | Based on Profit (Max RM 500k) | Based on Asset Value (Unlimited) |
| **Tenure** | 3 - 5 Years | 3 - 7 Years |
| **Approval Time** | 2 - 4 Weeks | **2 - 5 Days** |
| **Tax Benefit** | Interest Expense Deductible | **Capital Allowances + Interest Deductible** |

## 2. Why Equipment Financing is Cheaper

Because the loan is **secured** by the asset, the lender's risk is lower.
*   If you default on an SME Loan, the bank has to sue you (expensive).
*   If you default on Equipment Financing, the bank repossesses the machine (easy).

**Result:** Lenders offer **significantly lower interest rates** for equipment financing.

## 3. When to Choose an SME Business Loan

Despite the higher cost, clean loans are useful for:
1.  **Paying Salaries:** You can't finance payroll.
2.  **Marketing:** Ad spend, website development.
3.  **Renovation:** Office fit-out (unless you own the building).
4.  **Stock Purchase:** Buying raw materials.

## 4. When to Choose Equipment Financing

Always use this for:
1.  **Vehicles:** Lorries, Vans, Hilux.
2.  **Machinery:** Excavators, Cranes, CNC.
3.  **Warehouse Assets:** Forklifts, Racking.

**Why?**
Because you get **Capital Allowances** (tax depreciation). This can save you 24% in corporate tax, effectively making the loan interest-free in some cases.

## 5. Approval Speed: The Real Deal Breaker

*   **SME Loan:** Requires 2 years of audited accounts showing profit. Banks are very strict.
*   **Equipment Financing:** Requires 6 months bank statements. If you have a contract/project, approval is almost guaranteed.

**Ing Heng Advantage:**
We approve equipment loans in **24-48 hours**. SME loans take weeks.

## Conclusion

Don't use an expensive personal loan or SME loan to buy a machine. It's like using a credit card to buy a house. Match the financing tool to the purpose.
