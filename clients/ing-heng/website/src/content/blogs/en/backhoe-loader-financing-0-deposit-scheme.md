## 1. Why Finance a Backhoe? (Versatility)

Unlike a pure excavator or wheel loader, a backhoe earns money in 3 ways:
1.  **Trenching:** Digging drains/pipes (Backhoe end).
2.  **Loading:** Moving sand/debris (Front bucket).
3.  **Lifting:** Moving pipes/pallets (with forks).

**Result:** High utilization rate = Steady cash flow to pay the loan.

## 2. Monthly Installment Breakdown (New vs Used)

**New JCB 3DX (RM 280,000)**
*   **Deposit:** 10% (RM 28,000)
*   **Loan:** RM 252,000
*   **Interest:** 3.5% (5 Years)
*   **Monthly:** **RM 4,935**

**Used Case 580SN (RM 120,000)**
*   **Deposit:** 0% (RM 0)
*   **Loan:** RM 120,000
*   **Interest:** 5.5% (4 Years)
*   **Monthly:** **RM 3,050**

**Strategy:**
Buy Used. The monthly commitment is RM 1,900 lower. That's pure profit.

## 3. 0% Deposit Scheme for Operators

Are you an experienced operator (5+ years) wanting to become a boss?
We support you.
*   **Condition:** Show proof of experience (License, Reference Letter).
*   **Guarantor:** Need 1 guarantor with steady income.
*   **Result:** Get a used backhoe with RM 0 down payment.

## 4. Maintenance & Resale Value

Backhoes hold their value well if maintained.
*   **Case 580SN:** Very popular used. High resale value.
*   **JCB 3DX:** "The King" in Malaysia. Parts are cheap and everywhere.
*   **Caterpillar 428:** Premium brand. Strong resale but higher parts cost.

**Financing Tip:**
Stick to these big 3 brands for easier loan approval. Obscure brands (e.g., Hydrema) are harder to finance.

## 5. Documents for 0% Deposit Application

1.  **SSM Registration:** (Enterprise is OK).
2.  **Bank Statement:** 6 Months (Personal or Company).
3.  **Operator License:** GDL / Competency Card.
4.  **Job Letter:** Proof of upcoming work (e.g., "Contract to dig drains for Taman X").

## Conclusion

Don't wait until you save RM 30,000 for a deposit. If you have the skills and the jobs lined up, we have the financing.
