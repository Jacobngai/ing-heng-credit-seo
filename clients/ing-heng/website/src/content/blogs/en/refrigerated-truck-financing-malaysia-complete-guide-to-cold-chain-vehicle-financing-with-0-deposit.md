Cold chain logistics demands specialized equipment. Here’s why refrigerated truck financing opens massive opportunities:

**Cold Chain Market Reality in Malaysia:**

• Food delivery market: RM 2.8 billion annually

• Pharmaceutical cold transport: Growing 15% yearly

• Fresh produce distribution: 24/7 demand

• Temperature-sensitive goods: Premium pricing

**The 0% Deposit Cold Chain Advantage:**
When you walk past the RM 800,000 refrigerated truck at the food distribution center, knowing your competitors own their vehicles while you’re stuck with RM 25,000 monthly rental fees, does that sting in your chest knowing you’re building someone else’s business every single month?

**Transform From Renter to Owner:**
Refrigerated truck rental costs in Malaysia:

• Small chiller truck (3-ton): RM 8,000-12,000 monthly

• Medium freezer truck (5-ton): RM 15,000-18,000 monthly

• Large cold storage truck (10-ton): RM 22,000-28,000 monthly

• Annual rental: RM 96,000-336,000 (pure expense)

**Hassan’s Cold Storage Success Story:**
Hassan operated a seafood distribution business renting freezer trucks for RM 16,000 monthly. Banks demanded RM 120,000 deposit for a RM 480,000 refrigerated truck. We approved his application with **0% deposit** financing.

Initial Cash Required: RM 105,000
Monthly Payment: RM 4,685
**Our 0% Deposit Option:**

Purchase Price: RM 350,000  
Down Payment: RM 0 (0%)
Loan Amount: RM 350,000
Interest Rate: 6.8%
Tenure: 60 months

Initial Cash Required: RM 0
Monthly Payment: RM 6,925
**Cold Chain Financial Impact Analysis:**
