## Executive Summary: What Are the Rates Today?

**The Snapshot:**
Interest rates for excavator financing in 2026 have stabilized.
*   **New Excavators:** 3.5% - 4.5% p.a. (Flat Rate).
*   **Used Excavators (< 5 Years):** 4.5% - 5.5% p.a.
*   **Older Excavators (> 10 Years):** 6.0% - 7.5% p.a.

**Key Driver:**
Bank Negara Malaysia's OPR remains steady, but banks are tightening credit for older diesel machinery due to ESG pressures.

**Verdict:** To get the lowest rate, buy a newer model (Tier 3 engine or above) and maintain a healthy bank balance for 6 months prior to application.

## 1. New vs. Used Excavator Rates

The age of the machine is the biggest factor in your interest rate.

| Machine Age | Interest Rate Range (Flat p.a.) | Max Tenure | Margin of Finance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brand New (0 Years)** | 3.50% - 4.25% | 5 - 7 Years | Up to 90% |
| **Reconditioned (Unregistered)** | 4.00% - 5.00% | 5 Years | Up to 90% |
| **Used (1 - 5 Years)** | 4.50% - 5.50% | 4 - 5 Years | Up to 85% |
| **Used (6 - 10 Years)** | 5.50% - 6.50% | 3 - 4 Years | Up to 80% |
| **Old Iron (11 - 20 Years)** | 6.50% - 8.00% | 2 - 3 Years | Up to 70% |

**Ing Heng Difference:**
Most banks stop financing at Year 7. We finance up to **Year 20**.

## 2. Bank Rates vs. Credit Company Rates

Who offers the better deal?

### Commercial Banks (Maybank, Public Bank)
*   **Rate:** 3.5% - 4.5%
*   **Speed:** Slow (3-5 weeks)
*   **Strictness:** Very High. Need audited accounts.
*   **Best For:** Large construction firms buying new fleets.

### Credit Companies (Ing Heng, Pac Lease)
*   **Rate:** 4.5% - 7.0%
*   **Speed:** Fast (2-3 days)
*   **Flexibility:** High. Accept bank statements only.
*   **Best For:** SMEs, Sub-contractors, Urgent replacements.

## 3. How to Calculate Your Monthly Installment

The formula for Flat Rate interest is simple:
`(Loan Amount x Interest Rate x Years) + Loan Amount / Total Months`

**Example:**
*   **Loan:** RM 200,000
*   **Rate:** 5%
*   **Tenure:** 5 Years

*   Total Interest = RM 200,000 x 5% x 5 = RM 50,000
*   Total Payable = RM 250,000
*   **Monthly Installment = RM 4,166**

## 4. Hidden Factors That Affect Your Rate

1.  **Down Payment:** Paying 30% deposit can lower your rate by 0.5%.
2.  **Brand Value:** Kobelco, Hitachi, and Cat get better rates than Sany or XCMG because their resale value is higher.
3.  **Track Record:** If you have existing loans with the bank and pay on time, negotiate for a "loyalty rate."

## 5. 0% Interest Schemes? Be Careful.

Some dealers advertise "0% Interest."
*   **The Catch:** The machine price is marked up.
*   **Example:** Machine A costs RM 200k.
    *   Dealer 1: RM 200k + 5% Interest = RM 250k Total.
    *   Dealer 2: RM 250k + 0% Interest = RM 250k Total.
*   **Reality:** You pay the same. Always compare the **Total Payable Amount**.

## Conclusion

Interest rates are important, but they are not everything. A low rate is useless if the loan takes 2 months to approve while your project is waiting. Balance cost with speed.
