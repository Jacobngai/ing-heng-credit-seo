# Equipment Financing Up to 10 Years Old: Complete Policy Guide Malaysia

Looking to finance used equipment but worried about age restrictions? Good news: **we finance all equipment types up to 10 years old** with competitive rates and 0% deposit options available.

This comprehensive guide explains our age policy, valuation process, and approval requirements for excavators, lorries, forklifts, prime movers, bulldozers, and all other equipment types.

## Understanding the 10-Year Age Policy

### What "Up to 10 Years Old" Means

**Age calculation method:**
- Count from year of manufacture (not purchase year)
- Example: In 2026, we finance equipment manufactured in 2016 or newer
- 2015 model = 11 years old = not eligible
- 2016 model = 10 years old = eligible
- 2020 model = 6 years old = eligible

**Maximum age at time of application:** 10 years

**Why 10 years maximum?**
- Equipment retains sufficient resale value
- Remaining useful life supports loan tenure
- Parts and service still widely available
- Lower risk of major breakdowns during loan term

### Equipment Types Covered

**All equipment types accepted up to 10 years old:**

**Construction Equipment:**
- Excavators (mini, medium, large)
- Bulldozers (all sizes)
- Wheel loaders
- Backhoe loaders

- Specialized attachments

**No restrictions by equipment type - only by age!**

## How We Value Older Equipment

### Valuation Factors

**1. Year of Manufacture**
- Primary factor determining value

- 10-year-old equipment worth 25-40% of original price

**2. Equipment Condition**
- Excellent: Minimal wear, well-maintained
- Good: Normal wear, functional
- Fair: Higher wear, some repairs needed
- Poor: Significant wear, major repairs needed

**3. Brand Reputation**
- **Tier 1 brands** (Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi, Toyota, Hino):
  - Retain 30-50% value after 10 years
  - Easier financing approval
  - Better resale prospects

- **Tier 2 brands** (Doosan, Kobelco, SANY, Isuzu):
  - Retain 25-40% value after 10 years
  - Good financing terms
  - Acceptable resale market

- **Tier 3 brands** (Lesser-known Chinese brands):
  - Retain 20-30% value after 10 years
  - Higher deposit required
  - Limited resale market

**4. Operating Hours / Mileage**

**Excavators:**
- Under 5,000 hours = Excellent
- 5,000-10,000 hours = Good
- 10,000-15,000 hours = Fair
- Over 15,000 hours = Requires thorough inspection

**Lorries/Prime Movers:**
- Under 300,000 km = Excellent
- 300,000-600,000 km = Good
- 600,000-900,000 km = Fair
- Over 900,000 km = Higher risk

**Forklifts:**
- Under 8,000 hours = Excellent
- 8,000-15,000 hours = Good
- 15,000-20,000 hours = Fair
- Over 20,000 hours = Requires inspection

**5. Service History**
- Complete maintenance records = Higher valuation
- Regular servicing at authorized centers = Better
- Recent major overhaul = Positive factor
- No service records = Lower valuation

**6. Market Demand**
- High demand equipment (excavators, forklifts) = Better terms
- Specialized equipment = Case-by-case assessment
- Seasonal demand fluctuations considered

## Common Questions About Equipment Age

### Why not finance equipment over 10 years old?

**Risk factors increase significantly:**
- Resale value drops below 20% of original
- Parts availability becomes problematic
- Major component failures more likely
- Insurance costs rise substantially
- Remaining useful life uncertain

**Loan security concerns:**
- Equipment value may not cover loan balance
- If repossessed, resale difficult
- Higher default rates on very old equipment

**Better alternatives:**
- Finance newer used equipment (5-8 years)
- Trade-in very old equipment
- Cash purchase for equipment over 10 years

### Can age limit be waived for specialty equipment?

**Rarely, case-by-case evaluation:**

**Possible exceptions:**
- Very expensive equipment (RM 1M+) from premium brands
- Excellent maintenance records and low hours
- Recent major overhaul or refurbishment
- Unique equipment hard to replace
- Applicant has exceptional credit

**Example:** 12-year-old Caterpillar D9 bulldozer worth RM 800,000, only 3,000 operating hours, complete service records, recent engine rebuild.

**Result:** May be considered with 40-50% deposit

**Contact us to discuss specialty cases**

### Does equipment age affect loan tenure?

**Yes, inversely related:**

**General rule:** Loan tenure ≤ Remaining useful life

**Age 0-3 years:**
- Loan tenure: Up to 60 months (5 years)
- Reasoning: 15+ years useful life remaining

**Age 4-6 years:**
- Loan tenure: Up to 48 months (4 years)
- Reasoning: 10-15 years useful life remaining

**Age 7-10 years:**
- Loan tenure: Up to 36 months (3 years)
- Reasoning: 5-10 years useful life remaining

**Why it matters:**
- Protects lender from equipment becoming worthless
- Ensures equipment still valuable at loan end
- Aligns repayment with equipment lifecycle

### Can I refinance old equipment I already own?

**Not typically for equipment over 10 years:**

**Refinancing requirements:**
- Equipment must be within 10-year age limit
- You must have significant equity (50%+ paid)
- Equipment in excellent condition
- Good credit and payment history

**Example refinancing scenario:**
- 6-year-old excavator
- Original purchase: RM 600,000
- Current value: RM 350,000
- Outstanding loan: RM 100,000
- Equity: RM 250,000
- **Can refinance up to RM 245,000 (70% of value)**
- Use RM 100,000 to clear old loan
- Cash out RM 145,000 for business use

**Not available for equipment over 10 years old**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I finance equipment that is exactly 10 years old?

Yes, equipment that is exactly 10 years old (calculated from manufacturing year) is eligible for financing. For example, in 2026, equipment manufactured in 2016 is eligible. Equipment from 2015 or earlier is not eligible.

### Is 0% deposit available for 10-year-old equipment?

No, 0% deposit is not available for equipment aged 10 years. Equipment in this age range typically requires 20-30% deposit. 0% deposit is only possible for equipment aged 0-3 years with excellent credit and established business.

### How do you calculate equipment age?

We calculate age from the year of manufacture, not purchase year. Formula: Current year minus manufacturing year equals equipment age. Manufacturing year is found on serial number plate or registration documents.

### What happens if equipment fails inspection?

If inspection reveals significant issues, we may: (1) Reduce approved loan amount to match lower valuation, (2) Require higher deposit, (3) Request repairs before approval, or (4) Decline application if equipment value is too low. You can choose to repair and reapply.

### Do all equipment types have same 10-year limit?

Yes, the 10-year age limit applies to all equipment types including excavators, lorries, forklifts, prime movers, bulldozers, cranes, and all others. No exceptions by equipment type - only by age.

### Can I get better terms with comprehensive service records?

Yes! Complete service records can improve: (1) Equipment valuation by 5-10%, (2) Approval probability, (3) Potential deposit reduction, and (4) Faster approval process. Always provide maintenance records if available.
