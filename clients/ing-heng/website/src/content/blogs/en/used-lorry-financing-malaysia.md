## Why Buy a Used Lorry Instead of New?

Many Malaysian logistics businesses choose used lorries over new trucks. The reasons are clear:

**Cost Savings:**
- Used lorries cost 40-60% less than new trucks
- Lower down payment amount (RM 20K vs RM 80K)
- Faster break-even point for your business
- Better return on investment

**Immediate Availability:**
- New lorries have 3-6 month waiting periods
- Used trucks are ready to work immediately
- No manufacturing delays or supply chain issues
- Start earning revenue within 1 week

**Lower Depreciation:**
- New trucks lose 30% value in first year
- Used lorries depreciate slower (10-15% per year)
- Better asset value retention
- Lower loss if you resell later

A new Hino 300 Series costs RM 180,000. A 5-year-old model costs RM 90,000-110,000. You save RM 70,000-90,000 while getting the same capacity.

## Used Lorry Age Limits: What Can You Finance?

Banks and finance companies have different rules. Here's what you need to know:

### Category 1: 0-5 Years Old (Best Rates)

**Financing Terms:**
- Down payment: 10-20%
- Interest rate: 2.88-4.5% per annum
- Loan tenure: 5-7 years
- Approval rate: 90-95%

**Why It's Easy:**
- Trucks are still modern and reliable
- High resale value if you default
- Lower risk for finance companies
- Most brands accepted

**Best For:**
- Businesses needing reliable daily operations
- Companies with tight margins
- First-time lorry owners

### Category 2: 5-8 Years Old (Moderate Terms)

**Financing Terms:**
- Down payment: 20-25%
- Interest rate: 4.5-6.5% per annum
- Loan tenure: 3-5 years
- Approval rate: 75-85%

**Why It's Harder:**
- Higher maintenance costs expected
- Lower resale value
- Inspection required (mandatory)
- Some brands rejected (rare Chinese brands)

**Best For:**
- Businesses with backup vehicles
- Companies doing short contracts
- Experienced operators who can maintain older trucks

### Category 3: 8-10 Years Old (Stricter Requirements)

**Financing Terms:**
- Down payment: 25-30%
- Interest rate: 6.5-8.5% per annum
- Loan tenure: 2-4 years
- Approval rate: 60-70%

**Why It's Difficult:**
- High breakdown risk
- Major components near end of life (engine, transmission)

**Best For:**

## Down Payment Requirements by Lorry Age

Your down payment depends on the truck's age and brand:

### Japanese Brands (Hino, Isuzu, Fuso)

| Lorry Age | Down Payment | Why This Amount? |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| 0-3 years | 10-15% | High resale value, low risk |
| 3-5 years | 15-20% | Still reliable, good demand |
| 5-8 years | 20-25% | Moderate risk, inspection needed |
| 8-10 years | 25-30% | Higher risk, shorter loan tenure |

**Example:**
- RM 100,000 used Hino (6 years old)
- Down payment: RM 22,000 (22%)
- Loan amount: RM 78,000
- Monthly payment: RM 1,850 (48 months at 5.5%)

### European Brands (Volvo, Scania, Mercedes)

| Lorry Age | Down Payment | Why This Amount? |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| 0-3 years | 15-20% | Higher maintenance costs |
| 3-5 years | 20-25% | Expensive spare parts |
| 5-8 years | 25-30% | Specialist maintenance needed |
| 8-10 years | 30-35% | High repair costs, limited mechanics |

**Why Higher Down Payment:**
- European trucks have expensive parts
- Fewer mechanics can repair them
- Maintenance costs 40% more than Japanese brands
- Lower demand if we need to repossess

### Korean/Chinese Brands (UD, Foton, Shacman)

| Lorry Age | Down Payment | Why This Amount? |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| 0-3 years | 15-20% | Lower resale value |
| 3-5 years | 20-25% | Mixed reliability record |
| 5-8 years | 25-30% | Higher rejection rate |
| 8-10 years | 30-40% | Very difficult to approve |

**Note:** Some Chinese brands are not accepted if over 5 years old. Japanese brands are always easiest to finance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I finance a lorry with accident history?

**Answer:** Depends on the severity. Minor accidents (cosmetic damage) are usually okay. Major accidents (frame damage, chassis repairs) are automatic rejection. We check accident history through inspection and JPJ records.

### Do you finance lorries from auction sales?

**Answer:** Yes, but with stricter requirements. Auction lorries need thorough inspection. Down payment is typically 30-40% due to unknown history. Interest rates are 1-2% higher than normal used lorries.

### Can I refinance my existing lorry loan?

**Answer:** Yes! If your lorry is 5-10 years old and you've been paying another loan for 12+ months, we can refinance. You might get better rates, longer tenure, or cash out some equity.

### What if the lorry needs repairs before disbursement?

**Answer:** We can disburse in two stages: 80% to seller immediately, 20% held until repairs complete. This protects you and ensures lorry is in proper condition. Repair proof required (receipts, photos).

### Can I get financing if my business is only 1 year old?

**Answer:** Possible but challenging. We need: strong personal credit (700+), 30% down payment, solid contracts showing income, and guarantor (optional). Approval rate is 60-70% vs 95% for 3+ year businesses.

### How do I transfer ownership after financing?

**Answer:** We handle the JPJ transfer process. You provide signed transfer forms and supporting documents. We register our interest (lien) on the vehicle. Once loan is fully paid, we release the lien and you get clean ownership.

### Can I settle my loan early?

**Answer:** Yes! No penalty for early settlement. You pay remaining principal plus pro-rated interest up to settlement date. Many customers settle after 2-3 years when business cash flow improves.

### What happens if I miss a payment?

**Answer:** Contact us immediately. We understand business challenges. We can restructure payments, extend tenure, or defer 1-2 months if you communicate early. Repossession is last resort (only after 3+ months default).
