## Executive Summary: Bank or Credit Company?

**The Dilemma:**
You need to buy a machine. Do you go to a big bank (Maybank, Public Bank) or a specialized credit company (Ing Heng Credit)?

**The Short Answer:**
*   **Choose a Bank if:** You have perfect audited accounts, a high credit score, and can wait 4-6 weeks for the lowest possible interest rate (3.5% - 4.5%).
*   **Choose a Credit Company if:** You need the machine *now* (2-3 days), have minor credit issues (CTOS/CCRIS), or want 0% Down Payment flexibility.

**Key Difference:** Banks look at **past paperwork**. We look at **future potential** and the machine's value.

**Verdict:** For established corporations with planned capex, banks are great. For dynamic SMEs and contractors who need speed and flexibility, credit companies are the superior choice.

## 1. The Landscape: Who Lends Money for Machinery?

In Malaysia, there are three main tiers of lenders for equipment financing.

### Tier 1: Commercial Banks (Maybank, CIMB, Public Bank, RHB)
*   **Focus:** Large Corporate, MNCs, Very Strong SMEs.
*   **Pros:** Lowest interest rates (Flat 3.0% - 4.5% p.a.).
*   **Cons:** Strict criteria. Require audited accounts, high down payments (20-30%), and slow processing (1 month+). Often reject older machines (> 7 years).

### Tier 2: Development Financial Institutions (SME Bank, Agrobank)
*   **Focus:** Specific sectors (Agriculture, Manufacturing).
*   **Pros:** Government-backed schemes, sometimes subsidized rates.
*   **Cons:** Extremely slow processing (2-3 months). Very strict documentation compliance.

### Tier 3: Licensed Credit Companies (Ing Heng Credit, Pac Lease, Orix)
*   **Focus:** SMEs, Contractors, Logistics, Startups.
*   **Pros:** **Speed (2-3 days)**, High Approval Rate, Flexible Credit Criteria, Finance Old Machines.
*   **Cons:** Slightly higher interest rates (Flat 4.5% - 7.0% p.a.).

## 2. Feature Comparison: Bank vs. Ing Heng Credit

Let's break down the differences that matter to business owners.

| Feature | Commercial Bank | Ing Heng Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Approval Time** | 3 - 6 Weeks | **24 - 48 Hours** |
| **Interest Rate (Flat)** | 3.5% - 5.0% | **4.5% - 7.0%** |
| **Down Payment** | Min 20% | **0% Available** |
| **Machine Age Limit** | Max 7 - 10 Years | **Max 20 Years** |
| **CTOS / CCRIS Check** | Zero Tolerance | **Flexible / Discussable** |
| **Documents Required** | Audited Accounts (2 Years) | **Bank Statements (6 Months)** |
| **Site Visit** | Third-party Valuer | **Internal Officer (Next Day)** |

## 3. Why Speed Matters More Than Rate

"Is 1% extra interest worth it?"
Let's do the math on a **RM 100,000** used excavator loan over **3 years**.

*   **Bank (4.0%):** Total Interest = RM 12,000. Monthly = RM 3,111.
*   **Ing Heng (5.5%):** Total Interest = RM 16,500. Monthly = RM 3,236.

**Difference:** RM 4,500 over 3 years (RM 125/month).

**The Reality:**
If the bank takes 1 month to approve, your project is delayed by 30 days.
*   **Machine Rental Cost:** RM 8,000/month.
*   **Lost Revenue:** RM 15,000+/month.
*   **Total Loss:** RM 23,000.

**Conclusion:** Saving RM 4,500 in interest cost you RM 23,000 in lost opportunity. **Speed is profit.**

## 4. How to Choose the Right Lender for YOU

### Scenario A: The "Blue Chip" SME
*   **Profile:** 10 years in business, audited accounts show profit, RM 1M cash in bank.
*   **Need:** Replacing a fleet of 10 prime movers planned 6 months ahead.
*   **Best Choice:** **Bank.** You can afford the time and get the absolute lowest rate.

### Scenario B: The "Agile" Contractor
*   **Profile:** 3 years in business, profitable but cash is tight (reinvested in projects), no audited accounts yet.
*   **Need:** Excavator broke down on site. Urgent replacement needed within 3 days.
*   **Best Choice:** **Ing Heng Credit.** Speed is critical. You can't wait.

### Scenario C: The "Second Chance" Business
*   **Profile:** Good projects in hand, but Director has a small CTOS issue from a dispute 2 years ago.
*   **Need:** Buying a used crane to stop renting.
*   **Best Choice:** **Ing Heng Credit.** We listen to the story behind the data. If the CTOS issue is resolved or explainable, we approve. Banks will auto-reject.

## 5. Red Flags to Avoid (The "Ah Long" Warning)

Be careful. Not all non-bank lenders are legitimate.
*   **Licensed Credit Companies (KPKT):** Legitimate, regulated under the Moneylenders Act 1951. (Ing Heng is licensed).
*   **Loan Sharks (Ah Long):** Illegal. High daily interest. Harassment.

**How to Spot a Scam/Shark:**
1.  **Upfront Fees:** They ask you to pay a "processing fee" before approval. (Legit lenders deduct fees from the loan amount).
2.  **No Agreement:** No proper stamping or Hire Purchase agreement.
3.  **ATM Card:** They ask to hold your company ATM card. (Never give this!).

## Conclusion

The "right" lender depends on your specific situation.
*   If you have **time and perfect documents**, go to a bank.
*   If you value **speed, flexibility, and opportunity**, come to Ing Heng Credit.
