Why Fast Approval Matters for Prime Movers
          

          


            In the haulage industry, timing is everything. Shipping line contracts, port opportunities, and customer demands don't wait. When you find the right prime mover at the right price, you need financing **now**, not weeks later.
          



          


            Ing Heng Credit understands this urgency. With **24-hour approval** for complete applications, we help you:
          



          

- **Secure time-sensitive opportunities** - Don't lose contracts to faster competitors
- **Take advantage of dealer promotions** - Limited-time offers expire quickly
- **Meet shipping line requirements** - Some contracts mandate specific fleet capabilities
- **Start earning revenue sooner** - Every day without equipment is lost income



          
            Required Documents for Fast Approval
          

          


            The key to 24-hour approval is submitting **complete documentation** upfront. Missing information causes delays, so prepare everything before applying.
