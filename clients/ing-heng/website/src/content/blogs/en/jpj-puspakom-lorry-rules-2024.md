**Quick Summary:** Commercial lorries require PUSPAKOM inspection every 6 months costing RM55-RM75. New 2024 enforcement: 3+ brake test failures trigger automatic JPJ blacklist and road ban. Financing newer, compliant vehicles helps avoid these penalties.
          


        

        

## Understanding JPJ & PUSPAKOM Compliance



        


          For logistics operators in Malaysia, maintaining JPJ (Road Transport Department) and PUSPAKOM compliance is non-negotiable. These regulations ensure road safety and vehicle worthiness for commercial operations.
        



        


          Since **August 31, 2024**, PUSPAKOM's monopoly has ended, opening vehicle inspection to qualified competitors. This change aims to improve service quality and potentially reduce costs for operators.
        



        

### What is PUSPAKOM?



        


          PUSPAKOM is Malaysia's authorized vehicle inspection center. For commercial lorries, they conduct mandatory inspections to ensure:
        



        

- Roadworthiness and safety standards
- Proper load capacity compliance
- Emissions standards adherence
- Structural integrity of commercial vehicles



        

## Mandatory 6-Month PUSPAKOM Inspections



        


          Commercial lorries must undergo PUSPAKOM inspection **every 6 months** without exception. This requirement applies to:
        



        

- All goods-carrying vehicles (lorries, trucks)
- Prime movers and trailers
- Commercial vans with loaded weight >3.5 tons



        
          


            **Inspection Cost:** RM55-RM75 per inspection. Updated Commercial Vehicle (Goods) Inspection Guidelines were released in June 2024.
          


        

        

## Brake Test Penalty: The 3-Strike Rule



        


          The most critical enforcement in 2024 affects brake testing:
        



        
          

#### NEW: Brake Test Blacklist Rule


          

- **3+ Failed Brake Tests** = Automatic JPJ Blacklist
- JPJ notification triggers immediate road ban
- Vehicle prohibited from operation until compliance
- Financial losses from downtime and re-inspection


        

        


          *Financing Solution:* Newer lorries with modern braking systems significantly reduce failure risk. When financing through Ing Heng Credit, we help you select vehicles that meet current PUSPAKOM standards.
        



        

## Required Documentation for Commercial Lorries



        


          To operate a commercial lorry legally and qualify for financing, you need these documents:
        



        
          
            
              
                Document
                Description
                Priority
              
            
            
              {requiredDocs.map((doc, index) => (
                
                  {doc.doc}
                  {doc.description}
                  
                    
                      {doc.priority}
                    
                  
                
              ))}
            
          
        

        

## PUSPAKOM Inspection Checklist



        


          During your 6-month inspection, PUSPAKOM checks these critical areas:
        



        
          {inspectionChecks.map((item) => (
            
              

#### {item.check}


              

{item.details}


            
          ))}
        

        
          

#### Financing Tip


          


            When financing a lorry, ask for the PUSPAKOM inspection history. Vehicles with consistent pass records are better investments and less likely to face downtime from compliance issues.
          


        

        

## JPJ Commercial Vehicle License Renewal



        


          Commercial vehicle licenses follow different renewal rules compared to private vehicles:
        



        

- **First 2 years:** Maximum 1-year renewal period
- **After 2 years:** Maximum 6-month renewal period
- **Required:** Valid PUSPAKOM inspection for each renewal



        


          This means commercial lorries essentially require biannual inspections and license renewals, doubling the administrative burden compared to private vehicles.
        



        

## PUSPAKOM Monopoly Ends: What Changed?



        


          Effective **August 31, 2024**, PUSPAKOM's concession ended. The government now allows qualified competitors to provide vehicle inspection services:
        



        
          

#### Benefits for Operators


          

- Potential cost reduction through competition
- Improved service quality and faster turnaround
- More inspection center locations
- Better customer service standards


        

        


          *Important:* New inspection providers cannot be workshops (must adhere to regulations). This ensures impartial inspection quality.
        



        

## How Lorry Financing Helps with Compliance



        


          Financing your commercial lorry through Ing Heng Credit offers several compliance advantages:
        



        

### 1. Newer Vehicles = Fewer Compliance Issues



        


          Modern lorries come with advanced braking systems, better structural integrity, and emissions compliance. This reduces PUSPAKOM failure risk and prevents blacklisting.
        



        

### 2. Structured Maintenance Budget



        


          Hire purchase installments create predictable monthly expenses, making it easier to budget for biannual inspections, maintenance, and license renewals.
        



        

### 3. Documentation Support



        


          We guide you through the financing application with all required JPJ and PUSPAKOM documentation, ensuring your financed vehicle is fully compliant from day one.
        



        

### 4. Trade-In Options



        


          When your older lorry faces increasing compliance issues, we offer trade-in financing to upgrade to newer, more compliant vehicles with better inspection records.
