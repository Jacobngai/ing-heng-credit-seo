## Why Finance a Motor Grader Instead of Renting?

### 1. Stop Paying Rental Fees Forever

**Rental costs add up fast:**

• Small grader (140H): RM 8,000-12,000/month

• Medium grader (16H): RM 15,000-20,000/month

• Large grader (24M): RM 25,000-35,000/month

**Example: Medium motor grader rental**

• Monthly rental: RM 18,000

• 2-year project: RM 432,000

• **Result:** RM 432,000 spent, zero assets owned

**Instead, finance with 0% deposit:**

• Grader price: RM 800,000

• Finance 100%: RM 800,000 loan

• Monthly payment (60 months, 7% p.a.): RM 15,840

• **After 5 years:** Own RM 800,000 grader, save RM 300,000

### 2. Own the Asset from Day One

When you finance a motor grader:

• Build company assets for balance sheet

• Depreciation benefits for tax purposes

• Use grader for multiple projects (not just one)

• Sell or trade-in when upgrading equipment

• No daily rental charges eating project profits

### 3. Win More Infrastructure Contracts

Many government and large-scale projects require:

• Proof of owned equipment (not rental dependency)

• Financial stability (assets on balance sheet)

• Long-term capability (not limited by rental availability)

• Equipment reliability guarantees

**Owning your motor grader makes you more competitive** for major road construction contracts.

### 4. Better Project Cash Flow Management

Spread the cost over 36-84 months:

• Manage seasonal income fluctuations

• Align payments with project progress claims

• Preserve working capital for materials and labor

• Pay from project profits, not cash reserves
