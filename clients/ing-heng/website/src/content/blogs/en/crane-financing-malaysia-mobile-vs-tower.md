## Executive Summary: Lifting Your Business Higher

**The Investment:**
Cranes are the most expensive assets on a construction site.

*   **Tower Crane (New):** RM 800,000 - RM 1.5 Million.

**The Strategy:**
Don't use cash. Use **Project Financing**.

**Key Offer:**
*   **High Margin:** Up to 90% financing for established crane rental companies.
*   **Long Tenure:** Up to 5 - 7 years for new cranes.

**Verdict:** Whether you run a crane rental business or are a main contractor, financing allows you to bid for bigger jobs.

## 1. Mobile Crane Financing (The Workhorse)

Mobile cranes (Rough Terrain, Truck Mounted, All Terrain) are versatile assets.
*   **High Resale Value:** Easy to sell if you need cash.
*   **Brands:** Kato, Tadano, Sany, Zoomlion.
*   **Financing:** Easier approval than tower cranes.

**Terms:**
*   **Down Payment:** 10% - 20%.
*   **Interest:** 4.0% - 5.5% p.a.
*   **Tenure:** 5 Years.

## 2. Tower Crane Financing (The Static Giant)

Tower cranes (Hammerhead, Luffing Jib) are site-specific.
*   **Installation Cost:** High setup cost (RM 50k - 100k) is NOT financed.
*   **Resale Value:** Lower liquidity than mobile cranes. Harder to sell quickly.
*   **Brands:** Potain, Zoomlion, Yongmao.

**Terms:**
*   **Down Payment:** 20% - 30% (Higher risk for lender).
*   **Interest:** 4.5% - 6.0% p.a.
*   **Tenure:** 3 - 5 Years.

## 3. Financing for Crane Rental Companies

If your business is renting out cranes:
1.  **Show Contracts:** We need to see your rental agreements with main contractors.
2.  **Utilization Rate:** Prove that your existing fleet is busy (working > 20 days/month).
3.  **Maintenance Records:** Show you take care of your assets (DOSH/JKKP certificates).

**Ing Heng Support:**
We understand the "lumpy" cash flow of rental businesses (e.g., waiting 60-90 days for payment). We structure loans with flexible payment terms.

## 4. Safety & Compliance (DOSH/JKKP)

You cannot finance a crane without valid certification.
*   **PMA (Certificate of Fitness):** Must be current.
*   **Design Approval:** For imported tower cranes.
*   **Operator Competency:** Ensure you have certified operators.

**Tip:**
If buying a used crane from overseas (e.g., Japan/Singapore), factor in the cost of DOSH registration (RM 10k - 30k). We can sometimes finance this "compliance cost."

## 5. ROI Calculation: Rent vs Buy

**Scenario:** 24-month project requiring a 25T Mobile Crane.
*   **Rental Cost:** RM 12,000 / month = RM 288,000 Total.
*   **Purchase Cost (Used):** RM 350,000.
    *   **Loan Installment:** RM 6,500 / month = RM 156,000 Total (24 months).
    *   **Maintenance/Operator:** RM 5,000 / month = RM 120,000 Total.
    *   **Total Cost:** RM 276,000.
    *   **Residual Value:** You can sell the crane for RM 250,000 at the end.

**Result:**
*   **Rent:** Net Cost RM 288,000.
*   **Buy:** Net Cost RM 26,000 (after resale).
*   **Savings:** **RM 262,000**.

## Conclusion

For long-term projects (> 18 months), buying a crane is almost always cheaper than renting. Financing makes the purchase cash-flow positive from Day 1.
