Starting a crane rental business in Malaysia offers huge profit potential. Construction projects need cranes daily. Smart financing helps you start with 0% deposit.

When Ahmad sees crane rental trucks charging RM 15,000 per day for bridge work, RM 8,500 per day for building construction, and RM 25,000 per day for heavy industrial lifting, he thinks “I should be the one collecting those rental fees instead of paying them.”
