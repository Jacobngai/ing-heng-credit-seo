## Why Construction Contractors Choose Ing Heng Credit for Excavator Financing

Running a construction business means you need reliable equipment NOW, not weeks from now. When a new project starts, you can't wait months for bank approval. That's why we've spent 40 years perfecting fast, flexible excavator financing that works for Malaysian contractors.

### What Makes Us Different:

**2-Hour Approval - Not 2 Weeks**
Get approved in just 2 hours during business hours, not the 2-4 weeks banks require. Our streamlined process means you can secure equipment and start the project faster, protecting your contract timeline and reputation.

**Zero Upfront Payment - Preserve Your Cash Flow**
Finance up to 100% of your excavator's value with zero deposit required. Keep your working capital available for materials, labor, fuel, and emergency repairs instead of tying it up in equipment purchases.

**Flexible Terms That Match Project Cycles**
Choose repayment periods from 1 to 7 years. We structure payments around your project revenue cycles - whether you handle long government contracts or quick private jobs. Monthly rates from 2.5% flat.

**95% Approval Rate - We Say Yes When Banks Say No**
Our 40 years financing construction equipment means we understand the industry's ups and downs. We've approved contractors with seasonal income, multiple projects, and situations banks reject. Even if you've been turned down elsewhere, apply with us.

**Licensed & Transparent - No Hidden Surprises**
Licensed by KPKT since 1985. Zero processing fees. No hidden charges. No upfront payment required. All costs disclosed in writing before you sign. What we quote is exactly what you pay.

## How Excavator Financing Helps Your Construction Business Grow

### Preserve Working Capital for Operations
Don't drain your cash reserves buying equipment outright. Construction requires liquid capital for materials, subcontractors, payroll, fuel, and unexpected expenses. Finance up to 100% of equipment value and keep RM 200,000 - RM 500,000+ available for operations.

**Why contractors choose this:** One breakdown, one delayed payment, or one material price spike can cripple cash flow. Having capital reserves means you can handle these without missing payroll or delaying projects.

### Win Bigger Contracts With Better Equipment
Clients and government tenders often require specific equipment before awarding contracts. Modern excavators = bigger projects = higher revenue. Don't miss out on RM 500,000+ contracts because you lack a RM 300,000 excavator.

**Real example:** Hassan Construction added a Komatsu PC200 through our financing. Within 6 months, they secured 3 government contracts worth RM 1.2M total - projects they couldn't bid on before.

### Quick Approval Means Faster Project Starts
When you win a contract, project start dates aren't negotiable. Banks take 3-6 weeks for approval. We approve in 2 hours. Get equipment delivered within 3-7 days and start generating revenue immediately.

**Timeline comparison:**
- Bank approval: 3-6 weeks + equipment delivery
- Ing Heng approval: 2 hours + 3-7 days delivery
- **Result:** Start earning 3-5 weeks earlier

### Tax Benefits & Deductions
Financing may offer tax advantages versus purchasing outright. Lease payments may be fully deductible as operating expenses. Depreciation benefits for hire purchase. Consult your accountant about optimal structure for your tax situation.

**Tax efficiency:** RM 5,000/month financing payments could mean RM 60,000/year in deductible expenses versus slower depreciation schedules for purchases.

### Equipment Upgrade Path
Construction technology advances rapidly. Financing with flexible end-of-term options means you can upgrade to newer, more efficient excavators every 5-7 years without massive capital outlays. Stay competitive with the latest fuel-efficient, higher-productivity equipment.

## Success Stories: Malaysian Contractors We've Helped

### "Approved in 90 Minutes, Equipment On Site in 4 Days"

> "I won a government road project worth RM 680,000 but needed a 20-ton excavator to start. Banks wanted 4-6 weeks for approval. The project start date was in 10 days. I applied with Ing Heng at 10 AM and was approved by 11:30 AM. Equipment delivered in 4 days. We started the project on schedule and finished 2 weeks early. That early completion bonus paid for 6 months of financing."

**Ahmad bin Hassan**
Owner, Hassan Construction Sdn Bhd
Bukit Mertajam, Penang

*Financed: Komatsu PC200 Excavator - RM 380,000*
*Term: 5 years | Monthly Payment: RM 8,450*

---

### "Zero Deposit Let Me Take On 3 Projects Simultaneously"

> "I had strong project pipeline but limited cash. Buying an excavator outright would drain my working capital. Ing Heng's zero-deposit financing meant I could get the equipment without touching my reserves. I kept RM 200,000 liquid for materials and labor. That flexibility allowed me to handle 3 projects at once instead of 1. Revenue tripled in 8 months."

**Lim Wei Chuan**
Managing Director, Lim Brothers Construction
Klang, Selangor

*Financed: Hitachi ZX130 + attachments - RM 245,000*
*Term: 5 years | Monthly Payment: RM 5,450*

---

### "They Approved Me After Two Banks Rejected My Application"

> "I'm a new contractor with only 2 years in business. Two banks rejected my application because of my short business history. Ing Heng looked at my project contracts, cash flow, and experience in the industry. They understood construction better than banks. Approved in 3 hours. Now I have the excavator and just completed my biggest project worth RM 420,000."

**Raj Kumar a/l Subramaniam**
Owner, RK Earthworks & Construction
Ipoh, Perak

*Financed: Caterpillar 313D Excavator (used, 2019) - RM 195,000*
*Term: 4 years | Monthly Payment: RM 4,875*

---

### "Flexible Terms Matched My Seasonal Business Perfectly"

> "Construction work is seasonal. We have high revenue during dry months, low during monsoon season. Banks wanted fixed high payments year-round. Ing Heng structured graduated payments - lower during slow months (Nov-Feb), higher during busy season (Mar-Oct). This flexibility was crucial for our cash flow management and business survival."

**Tan Siew Hoon**
Director, SH Construction & Engineering
Kuantan, Pahang

*Financed: Kobelco SK200 Excavator - RM 365,000*
*Term: 6 years | Customized seasonal payments*
